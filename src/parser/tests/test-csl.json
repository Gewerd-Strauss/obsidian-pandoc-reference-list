		"abstract": "The mental health research literature on implicit bias is limited (Boysen, 2009), and little is known about how factors that are associated with self-perceived multicultural counseling awareness, such as mindfulness, relate to implicit racial bias in practicing mental health professionals. Using a correlational research design, we examined the association between mental health practitioners’ implicit bias, self-perceived multicultural counseling competence, facets of dispositional mindfulness, and mindfulness practices. A total of 137 mental health professionals completed an online questionnaire. Results revealed a negative relationship between the observing component of dispositional mindfulness and the implicit racial preference associating White and “good” words. In addition, results indicated that the frequency of engaging in mindfulness practices negatively predicted implicit racial preference associating White and good. Implications for counselor training, practice, and future research are discussed.",

		"abstract": "The authors analyzed findings from a counselor-delivered social and emotional learning and mindfulness-based intervention with twenty-three 3- and 4-year-olds from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Using a multilevel modeling approach to illustrate students’ growth across multiple behavioral observations in a randomized controlled design, the authors found that the treatment group exhibited more self-regulatory-related behaviors on days when the intervention occurred. Qualitative analyses revealed that the students adopted kindness language consistent with the intervention. Implications for practice are suggested.",

Previous authors have maintained a conceptual link between MCC and mindfulness; however, this is the first empirical analysis of the relationship between MCC and mindfulness. Results revealed that, after race/ethnicity, multicultural course completion, and empathy were controlled, components of mindfulness were correlated with multicultural awareness and multicultural knowledge. These results have implications for counselor education, counseling practice, and future research.",
