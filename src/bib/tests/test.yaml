    Mindfulness is a relatively new construct in counseling that is rapidly
    gaining interest as it is applied to people struggling with a myriad of
    problems. Research has consistently demonstrated that counseling
    interventions using mindfulness improve well-being and reduce
    psychopathology. This article provides a detailed definition of mindfulness,
    including a discussion of the mechanisms underlying mindfulness practice;
    explores the implementation of mindfulness as a counseling intervention; and
    examines literature supporting its effectiveness.

    Mindfulness has emerged as an important construct in the mental health
    field. Although evidence suggests benefits, it also appears that excitement
    over the clinical applications of mindfulness has largely suspended
    concentrated efforts to clarify fundamental elements of the construct. This
    article explores conceptual confusion and contrasts primary
    mindfulness-based techniques before investigating attrition factors, adverse
    effects of mindfulness practices, and populations contraindicated for
    mindfulness-based techniques. Implications for practice are provided.

    The authors examined the association between multicultural counseling
    competence (MCC) and mindfulness. Previous authors have maintained a
    conceptual link between MCC and mindfulness; however, this is the first
    empirical analysis of the relationship between MCC and mindfulness. Results
    revealed that, after race/ethnicity, multicultural course completion, and
    empathy were controlled, components of mindfulness were correlated with
    multicultural awareness and multicultural knowledge. These results have
    implications for counselor education, counseling practice, and future
    research.

    The mental health research literature on implicit bias is limited (Boysen,
    2009), and little is known about how factors that are associated with
    self-perceived multicultural counseling awareness, such as mindfulness,
    relate to implicit racial bias in practicing mental health professionals.
    Using a correlational research design, we examined the association between
    mental health practitioners’ implicit bias, self-perceived multicultural
    counseling competence, facets of dispositional mindfulness, and mindfulness
    practices. A total of 137 mental health professionals completed an online
    questionnaire. Results revealed a negative relationship between the
    observing component of dispositional mindfulness and the implicit racial
    preference associating White and “good” words. In addition, results
    indicated that the frequency of engaging in mindfulness practices negatively
    predicted implicit racial preference associating White and good.
    Implications for counselor training, practice, and future research are
    discussed.

    The authors analyzed findings from a counselor-delivered social and
    emotional learning and mindfulness-based intervention with twenty-three 3-
    and 4-year-olds from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Using a
    multilevel modeling approach to illustrate students’ growth across multiple
    behavioral observations in a randomized controlled design, the authors found
    that the treatment group exhibited more self-regulatory-related behaviors on
    days when the intervention occurred. Qualitative analyses revealed that the
    students adopted kindness language consistent with the intervention.
    Implications for practice are suggested.
