  {"id":"agren2014","abstract":"The reconsolidation hypothesis states that memories, when reactivated, enter a transient, labile state followed by a re-stabilization termed reconsolidation. By affecting the reconsolidation process, memory persistence can be influenced, leading to memory enhancement or decrement. This is a time-dependent process and the result of modulating reconsolidation is present only after the reconsolidation process is completed. Historically, reconsolidation research has been performed on non-human animals, since the methods originally used for reconsolidation disruption are not safe. However, there now exist several techniques safe for humans, and consequently, in recent years, papers on human reconsolidation have emerged. Here, the existing literature on human reconsolidation is reviewed and discussed, including studies on fear memories, appetitive memories, procedural memories, and declarative memories. Methods of memory reactivation are compared between studies, and the consistency and lack of consistency in results over reactivation methods and memory types are discussed. These results provide future challenges, both experimental and clinical, in defining the boundary conditions and mechanisms governing the reconsolidation phenomenon.

  {"id":"agrenetal2012","abstract":"Memories become labile when recalled. In humans and rodents alike, reactivated fear memories can be attenuated by disrupting reconsolidation with extinction training. Using functional brain imaging, we found that, after a conditioned fear memory was formed, reactivation and reconsolidation left a memory trace in the basolateral amygdala that predicted subsequent fear expression and was tightly coupled to activity in the fear circuit of the brain. In contrast, reactivation followed by disrupted reconsolidation suppressed fear, abolished the memory trace, and attenuated fear-circuit connectivity. Thus, as previously demonstrated in rodents, fear memory suppression resulting from behavioral disruption of reconsolidation is amygdala-dependent also in humans, which supports an evolutionarily conserved memory-update mechanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,28]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Agren","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Engman","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Frick","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Björkstrand","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Larsson","given":"Elna-Marie"},{"family":"Furmark","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Fredrikson","given":"Mats"}],"citation-key":"agrenetal2012","container-title":"Science","ISSN":"0036-8075","issue":"6101","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"1550-1552","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"JSTOR","title":"Disruption of Reconsolidation Erases a Fear Memory Trace in the Human Amygdala","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23269287","volume":"337"},
  {"id":"agrenetal2017","abstract":"Memories are not set forever, but can be altered following reactivation, which renders memories malleable, before they are again stabilized through reconsolidation. Fear memories can be attenuated by using extinction during the malleable period. The present study adopts a novel form of extinction, using verbal instructions, in order to examine whether fear memory reconsolidation can be affected by an imaginal exposure. The extinction using verbal instructions, called imaginal extinction, consists of a recorded voice encouraging participants to imagine the scene in which fear was acquired, and to envision the stimuli before their inner eye. The voice signals stimuli appearance, and identical to standard (in vivo) extinction, participants discover that the conditioned stimulus no longer is followed by unconditioned stimulus (UCS). In this way, imaginal extinction translates clinically used imaginal exposure into the standard experimental fear conditioning paradigm. Fear was acquired by pairing pictorial stimuli with an electric shock UCS. Then, both standard and imaginal extinction were given following fear memory reactivation, either after 10min, within the reconsolidation interval, or after 6h, outside of the reconsolidation interval. In vivo and imaginal extinction produced comparable reductions in conditioned responses during extinction and importantly, both disrupted reconsolidation of conditioned fear and abolished stimulus discrimination between reinforced and non-reinforced cues. Thus, disrupted reconsolidation of fear conditioning can be achieved without in vivo stimulus presentation, through purely cognitive means, suggesting possible therapeutic applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Agren","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Björkstrand","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Fredrikson","given":"Mats"}],"citation-key":"agrenetal2017","container-title":"Behavioural Brain Research","container-title-short":"Behavioural Brain Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2016.11.014","ISSN":"0166-4328","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,15]]},"language":"en","page":"9-15","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Disruption of human fear reconsolidation using imaginal and in vivo extinction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432816310403","volume":"319"},

Discourse analysis is used to challenge the biased notion that violence against women is an inherent component of Indian culture. The authors discuss the historical formation of ascribed gender roles and the development of subsequent attitudes that influence the way women are viewed culturally. Particular attention is given to the intersectionality of identities and their influence on the way violence against women is perceived, passively accepted, and internalized. The sociopolitical context of Sikhism and its formation as a response to the hierarchical nature of other religions and historical context is also explored.

  {"id":"alberthorowitz2009","abstract":"This paper compares the ethical standards reported by consumers and managers with different attachment styles (secure, preoccupied, fearful, or dismissing). We conducted two studies of consumer ethical beliefs and a third managerial survey. In Study 1, we used a questionnaire that we constructed, and in Study 2, we used the Muncy–Vitell Consumer Ethics Scale. The results in both the studies were consistent and showed that men reported a greater indifference to ethical transgressions than women. Based on the two studies, the results indicate that among male consumers, the dismissing participants reported the greatest overall indifference to ethical transgressions and the secure participants expressed the most ethical beliefs. The two intermediate groups did not differ significantly from each other. In Study 1, none of the women consumers reported a dismissing attachment style. Women with a secure style reported more ethical beliefs than those in the other two groups. However, the sample in Study 2 included dismissing women. The dismissing women reported the greatest overall indifference to ethical transgressions and the secure women expressed the most ethical beliefs. The illegal profit subscale described the most severe ethical transgressions, and for both men and women, the secure participants were less apt than the other participants to report a willingness to transgress. In Study 3, the Newstrom and Ruch (1975, MSU Business Topics, Winter, 31) Questionnaire was administered to 227 managers. All four attachment patterns were represented among the participants of both genders. In all cases, the participants with a dismissing attachment style showed the greatest readiness to transgress.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Albert","given":"Lumina S."},{"family":"Horowitz","given":"Leonard M."}],"citation-key":"alberthorowitz2009","container-title":"Journal of Business Ethics","container-title-short":"J Bus Ethics","DOI":"10.1007/s10551-008-9918-6","ISSN":"0167-4544, 1573-0697","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,7]]},"language":"en","page":"299-316","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Attachment Styles and Ethical Behavior: Their Relationship and Significance in the Marketplace","title-short":"Attachment Styles and Ethical Behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-008-9918-6","volume":"87"},

However, results have not been replicated. Additionally, associations of institutional betrayal with specific PTSD symptom clusters or sexual function are understudied. Method Female service members/veterans who reported experiencing MST (N = 679) completed self-report measures of PTSD and depression symptom severity, suicidal ideation, and sexual function. Institutional betrayal was assessed from free-text descriptions of self-reported index traumas. Results Institutional betrayal was significantly associated with more severe depression and PTSD symptoms, including avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, re-experiencing, and dysphoric arousal. Conclusions Targeting specific PTSD and depressive symptoms through evidence-based treatment may be important for managing institutional betrayal sequelae. Future research should identify specific strategies to help support survivors in their recovery following institutional betrayal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Andresen","given":"Felicia J."},{"family":"Monteith","given":"Lindsey L."},{"family":"Kugler","given":"Jordan"},{"family":"Cruz","given":"Rick A."},{"family":"Blais","given":"Rebecca K."}],"citation-key":"andresenetal2019","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Psychology","DOI":"10.1002/jclp.22773","ISSN":"1097-4679","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"1305-1319","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Institutional betrayal following military sexual trauma is associated with more severe depression and specific posttraumatic stress disorder symptom clusters","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.22773","volume":"75"},
  {"id":"ankeretal2016","abstract":"Background: Epidemiological studies and theory implicate drinking to cope (DTC) with anxiety as a potent moderator of the association between anxiety disorder (AnxD) and problematic alcohol use. However, the relevance of DTC to the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in those with a co-occurring AnxD has not been well studied. To address this, we examined whether DTC moderates the impact of two therapies: (1) a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) designed to reduce DTC and anxiety symptoms; (2) a progressive muscle relaxation training (PMRT) program designed to reduce anxiety symptoms only.\nMethods: Patients undergoing a standard AUD residential treatment with a co-occurring AnxD (N = 218) were randomly assigned to also receive either the CBT or PMRT. DTC in the 30 days prior to treatment was measured using the Unpleasant Emotions subscale of the Inventory of Drinking Situations.\nResults: Conﬁrming the predicted moderator model, the results indicated a signiﬁcant interaction between treatment group and level of pre-treatment DTC behavior. Probing this interaction revealed that for those reporting more pre-treatment DTC behavior, 4-month alcohol outcomes were superior in the CBT group relative to the PMRT group. For those reporting less pre-treatment DTC behavior, however, 4-month alcohol outcomes were similar and relatively good in both treatment groups.\nConclusions: These ﬁndings establish a meaningful clinical distinction among those with co-occurring AUD-AnxD based on the degree to which the symptoms of the two disorders are functionally linked through DTC. Those whose co-occurring AUD-AnxD is more versus less strongly linked via DTC are especially likely to beneﬁt from standard AUD treatment that is augmented by a brief CBT designed to disrupt this functional link.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Anker","given":"J.J."},{"family":"Kushner","given":"M.G."},{"family":"Thuras","given":"P."},{"family":"Menk","given":"J."},{"family":"Unruh","given":"A.S."}],"citation-key":"ankeretal2016","container-title":"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","container-title-short":"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.11.031","ISSN":"03768716","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2]]},"language":"en","page":"93-100","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Drinking to cope with negative emotions moderates alcohol use disorder treatment response in patients with co-occurring anxiety disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871615017858","volume":"159"},

  {"id":"anokhinetal2021","abstract":"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Despite numerous studies of its pathogenesis, processes leading to memory decay in Alzheimer's disease and tactics for its prevention are still in infancy. Here we propose a new hypothesis of memory autodegradation process in the brain compromised by neurodegeneration. A retrieval of an old consolidated memory, especially under conditions of novelty can render it to a labile form. This requires subsequent repeated consolidation, or reconsolidation. We argue that when an old memory is retrieved in the brain where reconsolidation processes are impaired by neurodegeneration, the original memory does not stabilize and degrades. Thus, being activated in a pathologically altered brain, memory trace weakens itself. If this suggestion is correct, then autodegradation of old memory in the impaired brain can be prevented by inhibiting its labilization during the retrieval. We started testing this hypothesis by employing a behavioral model of memory deficit produced by pharmacological impairment of memory reconsolidation in a one-trial passive avoidance learning model in young chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus). In previous experiments we demonstrated that retrieval of the passive avoidance memory paired with administration of a protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (ANI) or a glycosylation inhibitor 2-deoxygalactose (2DGal) resulted in the recall deficit. Here, we tested whether this memory impairment could be rescued by prevention of the memory labilization process. Two-days old chicks were trained in the passive avoidance learning model. Two hours after the training they were presented with a reminder paired with bilateral intraventricular administration of ANI (80 mkg) or 2DGal (3.28 mg) 5 min prior to the reminder. Additionally, 30 min before the reminder the animals received systemic administration of a non-competitive NMDA receptors antagonist MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) in order to access the possibility to prevent memory labilization and its effect. The control groups received physiological saline intraventricularly and intraperitoneally. The avoidance recall was tested 2 h after the reminder. The avoidance recall was significantly impaired in the animals which received ANI or 2DGal 5 min before the reminder as compared with control groups receiving no reminder or reminder coupled with physiological saline injection. Thus, inhibition of protein synthesis or glycoprotein fucosylation prevented reconsolidation of the reactivated memory producing amnesia. However, administration of NMDA antagonist MK801 prior to the inhibitor/reminder treatment prevented memory impairment resulting in high avoidance level that did not differ from the control groups recall. Thus, we have shown that memory deficit produced by memory retrieval under conditions of impaired protein synthesis can be protected by the preceding administration of NMDA receptor antagonist. We suggest that this effect might be due to prevention of reminder-induces memory trace destabilization which preserved the integrity of the original memory trace.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Anokhin","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Bezriadnov","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Solodovnikov","given":"Vasily"},{"family":"Tiunova","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"anokhinetal2021","container-title":"The FASEB Journal","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2021.35.S1.04034","ISSN":"1530-6860","issue":"S1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","license":"© FASEB","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"NMDA receptors antagonist prevents memory deficit produced by reconsolidation impairment in young chicks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2021.35.S1.04034","volume":"35"},

Data were collected during standard clinical operations at pre-treatment and 1-month (1 m), 3-months (3 m), and 6-months (6 m) post-treatment in an ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT treatment program in Mexico. Of the 86 SOFV that completed treatment, 45 met criteria for risky alcohol use at pre-treatment (mean age = 44; male = 100%; White = 91%). There was a significant reduction in alcohol use from pre-treatment (M = 7.2, SD = 2.3) to 1 m (M = 3.6; SD = 3.5) post-treatment, which remained reduced through 6 m (M = 4.0; SD = 2.9; p < .001, partial eta squared = .617). At 1 m, 24% were abstinent, 33% were non-risky drinking, and 42% were risky drinkers. At 6 m, 16% were abstinent, 31% were non-risky drinking, and 53% were risky drinkers. There were no differences between responders (abstinent/non-risky drinkers) and non-responders (risky drinkers) in demographics/clinical characteristics. However, there were significant and very large differences between responders and non-responders in PTSD symptom (p < .01, d = −3.26) and cognitive functioning change (p < .01, d = −0.99).

  {"id":"barrierscare","abstract":"The Department of Defense (DoD) strives to better understand the barriers to care that service members face regarding mental health diagnoses and treatment. Seeking care early can help service members address mental health conditions before they worsen. Despite the benefits of seeking mental health care, approximately 60-70 percent of military personnel who experience mental health problems do not seek mental health services. This underutilization of services may be ascribed to many types of barriers to mental health care.\n(H2) Mental Health Stigma\nMental health stigma is a dynamic process by which individuals internalize a marked identity about themselves and people with mental health disorders.  Mental health care stigma in the military stems in part from the military’s emphasis on certain qualities in service members (e.g., stoicism, strength, and independence). Service members sometimes believe that seeking mental health care conflicts with the personification of these qualities.\nWhile research indicates that stigma related to seeking mental health care remains a significant concern for service members, particularly those in need of mental health treatment, there are mixed findings about how it impacts treatment-seeking behavior or mental health service use. This stigma can have short-term and long-term impacts on service members’ intentions to seek treatment, beliefs and attitudes about treatment, readiness, reintegration, and quality of life. DoD promotes efforts to reduce mental health stigma including the Real Warriors campaign and resources developed by the Psychological Health Center of Excellence (PHCoE), such as Writing About Mental Health in the Military and Talking About Mental Health in the Military: A Guide for Leaders.\nAccording to the 2014 RAND Corporation report “Mental Health Stigma in the Military,” mental health stigma has been linked to four key interrelated factors:","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,22]]},"citation-key":"barrierscare","container-title":"Military Health System","language":"en","title":"Barriers to Care","type":"webpage","URL":"https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Centers-of-Excellence/Psychological-Health-Center-of-Excellence/Psychological-Health-Readiness/Barriers-to-Care"},

Furthermore, by virtue of its authoritative position, SBSE serves as an inﬂuential force in the construction of ‘normal’ adolescent sexuality and in the production of a particular kind of sexual teen. A multidisciplinary collection of comments and criticisms of SBSE are organized into a three-pronged critique: (1) SBSE attends exclusively to the dangers and risks associated with teen sex; (2) SBSE reiﬁes narrow deﬁnitions of normal teen sex as heterosexual and coital; (3) SBSE fails to address the interplay among gender, race, class and sexuality, while simultaneously propagating sexist, racist, and classist notions of sexuality. Through these presumptions and stereotypes, SBSE (mis)informs teens, projecting a particular message and vision of who and how teens are and should be.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bay-Cheng","given":"Laina Y."}],"citation-key":"bay-cheng2003","container-title":"Sex Education","container-title-short":"Sex Education","DOI":"10.1080/1468181032000052162","ISSN":"1468-1811, 1472-0825","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,4]]},"language":"en","page":"61-74","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The trouble of teen sex: The construction of adolescent sexuality through school-based sexuality education","title-short":"The trouble of teen sex","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1468181032000052162","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"bayeretal2022","abstract":"Growing evidence indicates that cannabidiol (CBD), a substance present in the Cannabis sativa plant, has potential therapeutic value to regulate abnormal emotional memories associated with post-traumatic stress and drug use disorders. CBD can attenuate their valence after retrieval (i.e., during reconsolidation) or potentiate their suppression by extinction. Pharmacological research has now focused on elucidating how it acts. Systemic antagonism of cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors has often prevented the abovementioned effects of CBD. However, it is unknown in which brain regions CBD stimulates CB1 receptors and how it interferes with local activity-related plasticity to produce these effects. The present study addressed these questions considering the reconsolidation of contextual fear memories in rats. We focused on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which comprises the anterior cingulate (AC), prelimbic (PL), and infralimbic (IL) subregions, as local activity or plasticity has been associated with the process to-be-investigated. Animals that received post-retrieval systemic CBD treatment presented relatively fewer cells expressing Zif268/Egr1 protein, a proxy for synaptic plasticity related to reconsolidation, in the AC and PL. At the same time, there were no significant differences in the IL. Pretreatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist AM251 into the AC, PL, or IL prevented the impairing effects of systemic CBD treatment on reconsolidation. CBD also caused reconsolidation impairments when injected directly into the AC or PL but not the IL. Together, these findings show complementary mechanisms through which CBD may hinder the reconsolidation of destabilized aversive memories along the dorsoventral axis of the mPFC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Bayer","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Stern","given":"Cristina A.

We point out specific advantages of interventions based on memory reconsolidation interference over traditional treatment for emotional disorders. We also explain how findings from basic research suggest limitations and challenges to clinical translation that may help to understand why clinical trials have met with mixed success so far and how their success can be increased. In closing, we preview new intervention approaches beyond the induction of amnesia that the phenomenon of memory reconsolidation may afford for alleviating the burden imposed by emotional memories and comment on theoretical controversies regarding the nature of memory reconsolidation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Beckers","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Kindt","given":"Merel"}],"citation-key":"beckerskindt2017","container-title":"Annual review of clinical psychology","container-title-short":"Annu Rev Clin Psychol","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816-045209","ISSN":"1548-5943","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,8]]},"page":"99-121","PMCID":"PMC5424072","PMID":"28375725","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Memory Reconsolidation Interference as an Emerging Treatment for Emotional Disorders: Strengths, Limitations, Challenges and Opportunities","title-short":"Memory Reconsolidation Interference as an Emerging Treatment for Emotional Disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5424072/","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"bedfordyeh2019","abstract":"In the field of psychology, filial piety is usually defined in terms of traditional Chinese culture-specific family traditions. The problem with this approach is that it tends to emphasize identification of behavioral rules or norms, which limits its potential for application in other cultural contexts. Due to the global trend of population aging, governments are searching for solutions to the accompanying financial burden so greater attention is being focused on the issue of elder care and its relevance to filial practices. We contend that the psychological investigation of filial piety in Chinese societies has progressed to the point that it can now provide a solid structure for research targeting intergenerational relations in other cultures. We describe an indigenous psychology approach that integrated Chinese historical, philosophical, and social trends to construct a model of filial piety in terms of the dual reciprocal and authoritarian filial aspects underlying parent–child relations: the dual filial piety model (DFPM). We use this model to re-conceptualize filial piety from its usual definition as a set of Chinese culture-specific norms to a contextualized personality construct represented by a pair of culturally-sensitive psychological schemas of parent–child interaction. We then describe how the DFPM can provide a framework for research on filial relations on individual, structural, societal, and cross-cultural levels. We conclude with a discussion of how the model may be able to integrate and extend Western research on intergenerational relations and contribute to the issue of elder care beyond Chinese societies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bedford","given":"Olwen"},{"family":"Yeh","given":"Kuang-Hui"}],"citation-key":"bedfordyeh2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"The history and the future of the psychology of filial piety: Chinese norms to contextualized personality construct","title-short":"The history and the future of the psychology of filial piety","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00100","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"bettsetal2023","abstract":"Quantification of childhood adversity has typically involved a cumulative risk approach in which total number of discrete adversities serves as an index of overall risk. However, this approach fails to account for the growing evidence of differential outcomes following exposure to childhood adversities. An alternative approach adopts a dimensional perspective, with growing evidence for distinct developmental impacts associated with exposure to threat (violence/abuse) and deprivation (neglect). This study developed a framework for the classification of these dimensions through a thematic analysis of health practitioners' views and accounts of different forms of childhood adversity. Ten health practitioners experienced in working with children with challenging behaviours and neurodevelopmental disorders participated in semi-structured interviews regarding definitions and examples of six categories of adversity: physical/emotional/sexual abuse, physical/emotional neglect, and domestic and family violence. The qualitative analysis identified 23 themes across the six categories of adversity, along with two overarching themes regarding ambiguity of classifying exposures and non-specific outcomes of exposures. Themes were integrated to provide a framework and checklist for classifying indicators of exposure to threat and deprivation. The findings offer a framework and checklist for the assessment of threat and deprivation that will allow for further testing of the dimensional risk model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Betts","given":"Joseph L."},{"family":"Ownsworth","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Dawe","given":"Sharon"}],"citation-key":"bettsetal2023","container-title":"Child Abuse Review","DOI":"10.1002/car.2796","ISSN":"1099-0852","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"language":"en","page":"e2796","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Development of a framework for classifying threat and neglect in childhood: A qualitative study","title-short":"Development of a framework for classifying threat and neglect in childhood","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/car.2796","volume":"32"},

Outcomes were assessed over the 32-week double-blind period following the first dose of study medication. The study was conducted at 2 academic centers in the US. Participants were recruited from the community between March 12, 2014, and March 19, 2020. Adults aged 25 to 65 years with a DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence and at least 4 heavy drinking days during the 30 days prior to screening were included. Exclusion criteria included major psychiatric and drug use disorders, hallucinogen use, medical conditions that contraindicated the study medications, use of exclusionary medications, and current treatment for AUD.Study medications were psilocybin, 25 mg/70 kg, vs diphenhydramine, 50 mg (first session), and psilocybin, 25-40 mg/70 kg, vs diphenhydramine, 50-100 mg (second session). Psychotherapy included motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy.The primary outcome was percentage of heavy drinking days, assessed using a timeline followback interview, contrasted between groups over the 32-week period following the first administration of study medication using multivariate repeated-measures analysis of variance.A total of 95 participants (mean [SD] age, 46 [12] years; 42 [44.2%] female) were randomized (49 to psilocybin and 46 to diphenhydramine). One participant (1.1%) was American Indian/Alaska Native, 3 (3.2%) were Asian, 4 (4.2%) were Black, 14 (14.7%) were Hispanic, and 75 (78.9%) were non-Hispanic White. Of the 95 randomized participants, 93 received at least 1 dose of study medication and were included in the primary outcome analysis. Percentage of heavy drinking days during the 32-week double-blind period was 9.7% for the psilocybin group and 23.6% for the diphenhydramine group, a mean difference of 13.9%; (95% CI, 3.0–24.7; F1,86 = 6.43; P = .01).

Focusing on victim experiences, an in-depth analysis of 20 cases collected as part of an empirical study into post-sentencing restorative justice practice after serious crime shows how a typical restorative process can mimic the conditions needed for ?memory reconsolidation?, a powerful and adaptive neurobiological mechanism that rewrites emotional memories. The findings suggest that the process of memory reconsolidation is a unique tool in the restorative justice ?black box?. While the use of restorative justice within Western criminal justice systems is routine for juvenile offenders following minor crimes, greater attention should be paid to victim-focused models in the aftermath of crime experienced traumatically; these include post-sentencing practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolitho","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"bolitho2017","container-title":"International Review of Victimology","container-title-short":"International Review of Victimology","DOI":"10.1177/0269758017714549","ISSN":"0269-7580","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,1]]},"page":"233-255","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Inside the restorative justice black box: The role of memory reconsolidation in transforming the emotional impact of violent crime on victims","title-short":"Inside the restorative justice black box","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0269758017714549","volume":"23"},

The robust correspondence between the brain networks encompassed cortical and subcortical hubs involved into fear processing in humans and in other species underscores the potential utility of comparing the modulation of brain circuitry in humans and animals, as a crucial step to inform the comprehension of fear mechanisms and the development of treatments for fear-related disorders.

  {"id":"boterhovendehaanetal2019","abstract":"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex condition often inﬂuenced by personality characteristics and comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. More recent understandings of PTSD have suggested that schemas play a role in the development and maintenance of this condition. Schema therapy (ST) was developed to address more characterological disturbances in chronic disorders. It is an integrative approach for treatment that incorporates practices from other therapeutic orientations. The purpose of this article is to describe some key components of ST and how these can be applied to the treatment of patients with more chronic or complex forms of PTSD. These components include formulating a patients’ symptom presentation in terms of their early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) and modes. The assessment of EMS, in particular, takes into account a patients’ developmental history and how it has impacted their response to a trauma. In addition, emotion-oriented and experiential techniques are key interventions in ST. Finally, ST has a unique perspective on the therapy relationship, which has been described as “limited reparenting.” A case study will be used to demonstrate how these components of ST were effective for intervention where previous techniques had failed. The article concludes with some of the research that supports these components of ST. Speciﬁc recommendations are made for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Boterhoven de Haan","given":"Katrina L."},{"family":"Fassbinder","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Hayes","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Christopher W."}],"citation-key":"boterhovendehaanetal2019","container-title":"Journal of Psychotherapy Integration","container-title-short":"Journal of Psychotherapy Integration","DOI":"10.1037/int0000120","ISSN":"1573-3696, 1053-0479","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3]]},"language":"en","page":"54-64","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A schema therapy approach to the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/int0000120","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"boutylinesoter2021","abstract":"Cultural schemas are a central cognitive mechanism through which culture affects action. In this article, we develop a theoretical model of cultural schemas that is better able to support empirical work, including inferential, sensitizing, and operational uses. We propose a multilevel framework centered on a high-level definition of cultural schemas that is sufficiently broad to capture its major sociological applications but still sufficiently narrow to identify a set of cognitive phenomena with key functional properties in common: cultural schemas are socially shared representations deployable in automatic cognition. We use this conception to elaborate the main theoretical properties of cultural schemas, and to provide clear criteria that distinguish them from other cultural or cognitive elements. We then propose a series of concrete tests empirical scholarship can use to determine if these properties apply. We also demonstrate how this approach can identify potentially faulty theoretical inferences present in existing work. Moving to a lower level of analysis, we elaborate how cultural schemas can be algorithmically conceptualized in terms of their building blocks. This leads us to recommend improvements to methods for measuring cultural schemas. We conclude by outlining questions for a broader research program.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Boutyline","given":"Andrei"},{"family":"Soter","given":"Laura K."}],"citation-key":"boutylinesoter2021","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/00031224211024525","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"728-758","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Cultural Schemas: What They Are, How to Find Them, and What to Do Once You’ve Caught One","title-short":"Cultural Schemas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224211024525","volume":"86"},

  {"id":"breypauker2019","abstract":"The current research tested whether differences in teachers’ nonverbal behaviors influence children’s intergroup attitudes and stereotypic beliefs. In this study, 5- to 8-year-old participants (N = 96) were assigned to novel groups (marked by T-shirt color) and then viewed interactions between teachers and pairs of students who were also members of the novel groups. Across four interactions, the teacher directed positive nonverbal behaviors toward students from one group and directed negative nonverbal behaviors toward students from another group. After viewing the interactions, participants were presented with pairs of new students from the two novel groups and were asked three types of test questions. When participants were asked who was smarter, they selected new students from the group that had received positive nonverbal behaviors regardless of their own group membership. However, when asked who they would like to befriend, only participants who were assigned to the group that received positive behaviors selected ingroup members. On trials where participants were asked to select a partner on an academic task, participants’ selections did not differ from chance. This study shows that teachers’ nonverbal behaviors may be one source of children’s academic stereotypes, including negative stereotypes about groups to which they belong. Moreover, these findings highlight the importance of subtle social cues in guiding children’s beliefs about social groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Brey","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Pauker","given":"Kristin"}],"citation-key":"breypauker2019","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jecp.2019.104671","ISSN":"0022-0965","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"104671","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Teachers’ nonverbal behaviors influence children’s stereotypic beliefs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096519301468","volume":"188"},

  {"id":"brown2010","abstract":"The Presence Process invites us to experience present moment awareness as a way of life, a daily approach to living on this planet. The Presence Process makes it possible for anyone to experience Presence and present moment awareness without having to take the long, challenging path most of us usually takeWhy is it so difficult to simply be present?The reason is that our deeply suppressed emotional imprints from childhood—which Eckhart Tolle calls “the pain-body”— distract us from an awareness of the present moment. Until this “emotional charge” from our past is integrated, all our attempts to quiet our thoughts and access the peace, joy, and love that are bedrock to our beingness are of only limited success. We all long to be free of our discomfort and experience inner peace. However, the attempt to get rid of our discomfort is misguided. We’re not broken and don’t need to be “healed.” Rather, our discomfort needs to be integrated.Because Presence is universal, it has the miraculous ability to manifest in our daily experience the exact circumstances required for us to integrate the dysfunction that keeps us from experiencing the radiance of present moment awareness. The Presence Process is a journey that guides us into taking responsibility for our emotional integration. It’s a way to consciously “grow up.”We are each responsible for determining the quality of our personal experience. The Presence Process teaches us how to exercise authentic personal responsibility in a practical manner. It reveals the mechanics that shape the way we feel about our life.

  {"id":"brown2020","abstract":"Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) is a diagnostic entity included in the International Classifications of Diseases, 11th revision (ICD-11). It denotes a severe form of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is the result of prolonged and repeated trauma. C-PTSD is associated with a broad spectrum of psychopathological symptoms and transcends the typical diagnostic criteria for PTSD. C-PTSD is conceptualized as including the core elements of PTSD, such as re-experiencing, avoidance, and hypervigilance, with the additional symptoms of poor affect regulation, negative self-concept, and difficulties in establishing and maintaining healthy interpersonal relationships. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model share a common treatment approach, and their integration has been found to enhance the efficacy of both modalities in the treatment of complex trauma. This article explores IFS-informed EMDR (IFS-EMDR) for the treatment of C-PTSD. IFS-EMDR creates an integration of the contemporary practice of EMDR with the interweave of the IFS model for positive resourcing. This article will firstly provide an exploration of insecure attachment and relational trauma as diathetic factors to the development of C-PTSD. Subsequently, this article will review how trauma and the emergence of structural dissociation impact the development of the self through the lens of IFS. Finally, through the use of a composite case study, this paper will discuss the benefits of integrating IFS strategies and language into EMDR therapy, with particular attention to challenges and limitations.","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Gillian O’Shea"}],"citation-key":"brown2020","container-title":"International Body Psychotherapy Journal","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"112-122","source":"Zotero","title":"Internal Family Systems informed eye movement desensitization and reprocessing","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"brownetal2019","abstract":"This article examines the therapeutic potential of ibogaine, a powerful oneiric alkaloid derived from Tabernanthe iboga, through exploring the subjective experiences of 44 participants from two observational treatment studies for opioid use disorder. Following treatment with ibogaine HCl, the participants (Mexico, n = 30; New Zealand, n = 14) completed the States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SCQ) to quantify the magnitude of their psychotropic experience. Participants were asked to provide written transcripts of their experiences, with those supplied being analyzed thematically through an iterative process, to produce a set of coded themes. Mean SCQ scores in many domains exceeded 0.6, the cutoff score for a “complete mystical experience,” with 43% of participants achieving this in more than five of seven domains. Qualitative data described multiple phenomenological themes, including auditory and visual phenomena. Ibogaine’s strong oneiric action promoted cyclic visions leading to confronting realizations involving remorse and regret for participants’ actions towards others, but also release from feelings of guilt and worthlessness. Many participants reported feeling a sense of spiritual transformation. We propose that the reported experiences support the meaningfulness of ibogaine’s oneiric effects as a discrete element in its capacity for healing, which is distinct from pharmacological actions associated with reduced withdrawal and craving.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Thomas K."},{"family":"Noller","given":"Geoff E."},{"family":"Denenberg","given":"Julie O."}],"citation-key":"brownetal2019","container-title":"Journal of Psychoactive Drugs","container-title-short":"Journal of Psychoactive Drugs","DOI":"10.1080/02791072.2019.1598603","ISSN":"0279-1072, 2159-9777","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,15]]},"language":"en","page":"155-165","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ibogaine and subjective experience: Transformative states and psychopharmacotherapy in the treatment of opioid use disorder","title-short":"Ibogaine and subjective experience","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02791072.2019.1598603","volume":"51"},

Seventy-one participants viewed a traumatic film and recorded the frequency, distress, and vividness of subsequent intrusive memories for the following week. The day after initial consolidation, the memory was reactivated before presentation of either an attachment or a positive nonattachment control prime. The attachment prime reduced the vividness and distress of intrusions during the ensuing week.

  {"id":"careystiles2016","abstract":"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are currently the dominant methodology for evaluating psychological treatments. They are widely regarded as the gold standard, and in the current climate, it is unlikely that any particular psychotherapy would be considered evidence-based unless it had been subjected to at least one, and usually more, RCTs. Despite the esteem within which they are held, RCTs have serious shortcomings. They are the methodology of choice for answering some questions but are not well suited for answering others. In particular, they seem poorly suited for answering questions related to why therapies work in some situations and not in others and how therapies work in general. Ironically, the questions that RCTs cannot answer are the questions that are of most interest to clinicians and of most benefit to patients. In this paper, we review some of the shortcomings of RCTs and suggest a number of other approaches. With a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of RCTs and a greater awareness of other research strategies, we might begin to develop a more realistic and precise understanding of which treatment options would be most effective for particular clients with different problems and in different circumstances.

  {"id":"carvalhoetal2019","abstract":"Alcohol use disorders consist of disorders characterised by compulsive heavy alcohol use and loss of control over alcohol intake. Alcohol use disorders are some of the most prevalent mental disorders globally, especially in high-income and upper-middle-income countries; and are associated with high mortality and burden of disease, mainly due to medical consequences, such as liver cirrhosis or injury. Despite their high prevalence, alcohol use disorders are undertreated partly because of the high stigma associated with them, but also because of insufficient systematic screening in primary health care, although effective and cost-effective psychosocial and pharmacological interventions do exist. Primary health care should be responsible for most treatment, with routine screening for alcohol use, and the provision of a staggered treatment response, from brief advice to pharmacological treatment. Clinical interventions for these disorders should be embedded in a supportive environment, which can be bolstered by the creation of alcohol control policies aimed at reducing the overall level of consumption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Carvalho","given":"Andre F"},{"family":"Heilig","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Perez","given":"Augusto"},{"family":"Probst","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Rehm","given":"Jürgen"}],"citation-key":"carvalhoetal2019","container-title":"The Lancet","container-title-short":"The Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31775-1","ISSN":"0140-6736","issue":"10200","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,31]]},"language":"en","page":"781-792","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Alcohol use disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673619317751","volume":"394"},

  {"id":"chenetal2021","abstract":"Reactivation of consolidated memory can induce a labile period, in which the memory might be susceptible to change and need reconsolidation. Prediction error (PE) has been recognized as a necessary boundary condition for memory destabilization, and stronger memories are resistant to destabilization. This study investigated whether different strengths of conditioned fear memories require different degrees of PE during memory reactivation in order for the memories to become destabilized. Here we assessed the fear-potentiated startle and skin conductance response, used the post-retrieval extinction procedure. A violation of expectancy (PE) was induced during retrieval to reactivate enhanced (unpredictable-shock) or ordinary (predictable-shock) fear memories that were established the day before. Results showed that a PE retrieval before extinction can prevent the return of predictable-shock fear memory, but cannot prevent the return of unpredictable-shock fear memory, indicating that single PE is insufficient to destabilize enhanced fear memory. Therefore, we further determined whether increasing the degree of PE could destabilize enhanced fear memory using different retrieval strategies (multiple PEs retrieval and unreinforced CS retrieval). We found that spontaneous recovery of enhanced fear memory was prevented in both retrieval strategies, but reinstatement was only prevented in the multiple PEs retrieval group, suggesting that a larger amount of PE is needed to destabilize enhanced fear memory. The findings suggest that behavioral updating during destabilization requires PE, and the degree of PE needed to induce memory destabilization during memory retrieval depends on the strength of fear memory. The study indicates that memory reconsolidation inference can be used to destabilize stronger memories, and the findings shed lights on the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders and anxiety disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Junjiao"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Shaochen"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Min"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Xifu"}],"citation-key":"chenetal2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"chinzeber2020","abstract":"Studies examining the mental health outcomes of military personnel deployed into combat zones have focused on the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder conferred by mild or moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, other mental health outcomes among veterans who sustained critical combat injuries have not been described.We examined the associations of moderate and severe TBI and combat injury with the risk for anxiety and mood disorders, adjustment reactions, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, cognitive disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of U.S. military service members critically injured in combat during military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan from February 1, 2002, to February 1, 2011. Health care encounters from (1) the Department of Defense (DoD) Trauma Registry (TR), (2) acute and ambulatory care in military facilities, and (3) civilian facilities are reimbursed by Tricare. Service members who sustained severe combat injury require critical care. We estimated the risk of mental health outcomes using risk-adjusted logit models for demographic and clinical factors. We explored the relationship between TBI and the total number of mental health diagnoses.Of the 4,980 subjects who met inclusion criteria, most injuries occurred among members of the Army (72%) or Marines (25%), with mean (SD) age of 25.5(6.1) years. The prevalence of moderate or severe TBI was 31.6% with explosion as the most common mechanism of injury (78%). We found 71% of the cohort was diagnosed with at least one poor mental health condition, and the adjusted risk conferred by TBI ranged from a modest increase for anxiety disorder (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11–1.45) to a large increase for cognitive disorder (odds ratio, 3.24; 95% CI, 2.78–3.77). We found TBI was associated with an increased number of mental health diagnoses (incidence rate ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.42–1.63).Combat-associated TBI may have a broad effect on several mental health conditions among critically injured combat casualties. Early recognition and treatment for trauma-associated mental health are crucial to improving outcomes among service personnel as they transition to post-deployment care in the DoD, Department of Veterans Affairs, or community health systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Chin","given":"David L"},{"family":"Zeber","given":"John E"}],"citation-key":"chinzeber2020","container-title":"Military Medicine","container-title-short":"Military Medicine","DOI":"10.1093/milmed/usz440","ISSN":"0026-4075","issue":"5-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,8]]},"page":"e711-e718","source":"Silverchair","title":"Mental Health Outcomes Among Military Service Members After Severe Injury in Combat and TBI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usz440","volume":"185"},

But just as rich and complex as the external world is the internal milieu—our imagination. Imagination offers a powerful vehicle for playing out hypothetical experiences in the mind’s eye. It allows us to mentally time travel to behold what the future might bring, including our greatest desires or fears. Indeed, imagined experiences tend to be emotion-laden. How and why are humans capable of this remarkable feat? Based on psychological findings, we highlight the importance of imagination for emotional aspects of cognition and behaviour, namely in the generation and regulation of emotions. Based on recent cognitive neuroscience work, we identify putative neural networks that are most critical for emotional imagination, with a large focus on the default mode network. Finally, we briefly highlight possible functional implications of individual differences in imagination. Overall, we hope to address why we as humans have the capacity to simulate hypothetical emotional experiences and how this ability can be harnessed in adaptive (and sometimes maladaptive) ways.

  {"id":"corbettetal2009","abstract":"METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 high-risk heterosexual couples, including HIV-serodiscordant couples, participating in a trial of the female condom in Hartford in 2004–2007. Data were coded and analyzed in an iterative inductive and deductive process.\nRESULTS: Participants described nonuse of condoms as a strategy to find and maintain a primary relationship, establish trust and increase intimacy. Many had unprotected intercourse while recognizing their risk of HIV and other STDs, placing their love for their partner and other emotional needs over concerns about their health. Several couples reduced their STD risk by practicing negotiated safety (i.e., using condoms until their serostatus had been determined) or similar strategies, including sharing sexual or drug use history, disclosing HIV test results and using condoms until they decided that their relationship would be monogamous.\nCONCLUSIONS: HIV prevention approaches must recognize the importance of love and the needs that primary relationships satisfy if they are to be considered relevant by those at greatest risk. Negotiated safety and similar strategies may be an important risk reduction tool for heterosexuals, particularly those in HIV-affected relationships, but their potential effectiveness may vary.

There is continued discrimination against women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people, immigrants, and Muslims. This book provides a basic introduction to the psychology of oppression that will be useful in making oppression and social justice education more accessible to more people. It is very timely as it may reach and inform a wider range of people about various forms of oppression and how they influence peoples’ psychological experiences. The book is organized into ten chapters. The first three chapters focus on the fundamentals of oppression. Chapter one provides a brief overview of what oppression is. Chapter two deals with historically and contemporarily oppressed social groups. Chapter three presents historical and contemporary oppression. The next three chapters discuss some of the layers and complexities of oppression. Chapter four covers the evolution of oppression and how oppression may be expressed blatantly or subtly and overtly or covertly. Chapter five describes the three Is of oppression: interpersonal, institutional, and internalized. Chapter six presents the psychological and mental health implications of oppression. The chapters 7 through 9, discuss why oppression exists and continues to persist throughout history. Chapter seven presents the social psychological theories on the existence and persistence of oppression. Chapter eight and nine describes addressing oppression in both clinical and community contexts. The final chapter presents some suggestions about future psychological work on oppression across research, clinical, and community contexts.","author":[{"family":"David","given":"E. J.

  {"id":"deaketal2019","abstract":"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) represents a significant and ongoing public health concern with 12-month prevalence estimates of ∼5.6%. Quantitative genetic studies suggest a heritability of approximately 50% for AUD, and as a result, significant efforts have been made to identify specific variation within the genome related to the etiology of AUD. Given the limited number of replicable findings that have emerged from genome-wide linkage and candidate gene association studies, more recent efforts have focused on the use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These studies have suggested that hundreds of variants across the genome, most of small effect (R2 < 0.002), contribute to the genetic etiology of AUD. The present review describes the initial, though limited, successes of GWAS to identify loci related to risk for AUD as well as other etiologically relevant traits (e.g. alcohol consumption). In addition, ‘Post-GWAS’ approaches that rely on GWAS data to estimate the heritability and co-heritability of traits, test causal relations between traits, and aid in gene discovery are described. Together, the described research findings illustrate the importance of molecular genetic research on AUD as we seek to better understand the mechanisms through which genetic variation leads to increased risk for AUD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Deak","given":"Joseph D"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Alex P"},{"family":"Gizer","given":"Ian R"}],"citation-key":"deaketal2019","collection-title":"Genetics","container-title":"Current Opinion in Psychology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.07.012","ISSN":"2352-250X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"56-61","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Genetics of alcohol use disorder: A review","title-short":"Genetics of alcohol use disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X18301118","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"deandradeetal2019","abstract":"Background\nResidential treatment is a standard treatment for individuals with severe and complex substance use problems. However, there is limited evidence on best practice approaches to treatment in these settings. This review provides a comprehensive update on the evidence base for residential treatment, and directions for future research and clinical practice.\nMethod\nA systematic review of all studies published between January 2013 and December 2018 was conducted. Public health and psychology databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsycARTICLES and PsycINFO) were systematically searched, and forward and backward snowballing were used to identify additional studies. Studies were included if they were quantitative, assessed the effectiveness of residential substance treatment programs for adults, were published in the English language and in peer-reviewed journals. The Effective Public Health Practice Project’s Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies was used to assess methodological quality.\nResults\nOur search identified 23 studies. Eight were rated as methodologically strong, five as moderate and ten rated as weak. Quality ratings were impacted by attrition at follow-up and research design. Despite limitations, results provide moderate quality evidence for the effectiveness of residential treatment in improving outcomes across a number of substance use and life domains.\nConclusion\nWith caution, results suggest that best practice rehabilitation treatment integrates mental health treatment and provides continuity of care post-discharge. Future research and practice should focus on better collection of outcome data and conducting data linkage of key health, welfare and justice agency administrative data to enhance understanding of risk and recovery trajectories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Andrade","given":"Dominique","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Elphinston","given":"Rachel A."},{"family":"Quinn","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Allan","given":"Julaine"},{"family":"Hides","given":"Leanne"}],"citation-key":"deandradeetal2019","container-title":"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","container-title-short":"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.03.031","ISSN":"0376-8716","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"227-235","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The effectiveness of residential treatment services for individuals with substance use disorders: A systematic review","title-short":"The effectiveness of residential treatment services for individuals with substance use disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871619301875","volume":"201"},

  {"id":"desaluetal2019","abstract":"Background and Aims:\nFindings of the association between racial discrimination and alcohol use and related consequences are inconsistent and the role of potential moderators in the association is largely unknown. This meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the discrimination-alcohol literature among Black Americans, estimate magnitude of associations, and explore differences as a function of sample characteristics.\n\nMethods:\nEmpirical studies reporting the association of racial discrimination with alcohol-related behaviors in an all-Black sample were identified via systematic literature search. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using 33 effect sizes extracted from 27 studies, all of which used U.S. samples (n = 26,894).\n\nResults:\nSignificant positive associations were found for racial discrimination with alcohol consumption (k = 9, CI = [0.08, 0.17], I2 = 49%, r = .12), heavy/binge drinking (k = 12, CI = [0.02, 0.10], I2 = 27%, r = .06), at-risk drinking (k = 4, CI = [0.06, 0.23], I2 = 0%, r = .14), and negative drinking consequences (k = 5, CI = [0.09, 0.25], I2 = 94%, r = .25), but not with alcohol use disorder (k = 3, CI = [−0.01, 0.20], I2 = 90%, r = .10). Only alcohol consumption and negative drinking consequences showed significant between-study heterogeneity and had a sufficient quantity of studies for moderation analysis (k ≥ 4). The positive association of racial discrimination with negative drinking consequences was stronger among younger samples; the association with alcohol consumption did not differ by age or proportion of men.\n\nConclusions:\nExperiences of racial discrimination are associated with diverse alcohol-related behaviors among Black Americans, with a stronger association with problematic alcohol use particularly among younger individuals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Desalu","given":"Jessica M."},{"family":"Goodhines","given":"Patricia A."},{"family":"Park","given":"Aesoon"}],"citation-key":"desaluetal2019","container-title":"Addiction (Abingdon, England)","container-title-short":"Addiction","DOI":"10.1111/add.14578","ISSN":"0965-2140","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6]]},"page":"957-967","PMCID":"PMC6510626","PMID":"30714661","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Racial discrimination and alcohol use and negative drinking consequences among Black Americans: A meta-analytic review","title-short":"Racial discrimination and alcohol use and negative drinking consequences among black americans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6510626/","volume":"114"},
  {"id":"deveenetal2017","abstract":"Introduction: Evidence based treatment for Substance use disorders (SUD) includes psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. However, these are only partially effective. Hallucinogens, such as psilocybin, may represent potential new treatment options for SUD. This review provides a summary of (human) studies on the putative therapeutic effects of psilocybin, and discusses the receptor systems, brain regions and cognitive and emotional processes mediating psilocybin’s effects. Psilocybin’s chemical structure is similar to that of serotonin. Dysregulations in the serotonin system are associated with alterations in stress hormones, such as cortisol, and mood disorders. After psilocybin administration cortisol levels spike and activate the executive control network, with subsequent increased control over emotional processes, and relief of negative thinking and persistent negative emotions. Preliminary data of ongoing alcohol and smoking addiction studies in humans shows promising effects of psilocybin administration on substance use. Importantly, psilocybin has a low risk of toxicity and dependence and can be used safely under controlled clinical conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"De Veen","given":"Bas T.H."},{"family":"Schellekens","given":"Arnt F.A."},{"family":"Verheij","given":"Michel M.M."},{"family":"Homberg","given":"Judith R."}],"citation-key":"deveenetal2017","container-title":"Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics","container-title-short":"Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics","DOI":"10.1080/14737175.2016.1220834","ISSN":"1473-7175, 1744-8360","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2]]},"language":"en","page":"203-212","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Psilocybin for treating substance use disorders?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737175.2016.1220834","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"donaldcarey2017","abstract":"Quantitative methods and methodologies have dominated research on the efficacy and effectiveness of psychotherapy. The value of the quantitative paradigm is reflected in the criteria used to establish empirically supported treatments. However, quantitative research, including randomised control trials (RCTs), may not be ideally suited to establishing the effectiveness of the complex process of psychotherapy. The process and outcomes of psychotherapy have been regarded as causally entangled; the client's and therapist's efforts to responsively regulate the therapeutic process should be seen as being integral to outcomes rather than a source of confounding variance. Qualitative research may provide additional insights into the process of how psychotherapy is effective, due to its ability to explore phenomena from multiple perspectives. This is particularly important as research has suggested that qualitative differences in treatments can be masked beneath quantitatively equivalent outcomes. As a result, a continued overreliance on quantitative research may limit the discipline's overall ability to account for and differentiate the effectiveness of psychotherapies. This article proposes that, in order to address this limitation, (i) the criteria for how psychotherapies are considered effective should be expanded to include factors such as the efficiency of treatments, rates of change, and reliability of change; (ii) and that qualitative research be used adjunctively to assess and explore the dimensions of the expanded criteria. The development of a methodologically integrative multidimensional assessment of treatment effectiveness will provide a more informative tool to guide clinical decision making and policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Donald","given":"Ian N."},{"family":"Carey","given":"Timothy A."}],"citation-key":"donaldcarey2017","container-title":"Psychotherapy and Politics International","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ppi.1424","ISSN":"1556-9195","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","page":"e1424","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Improving knowledge about the effectiveness of psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ppi.1424","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"donohoetal2018","abstract":"Background More than a decade of war has strained service members and their families and the psychological health of military spouses is a concern. This study uses data from the largest study of military families in the United States to examine the demographic, military-specific, and service member mental health correlates of probable diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) among military spouses. Methods Data were from service member-spouse dyads from all branches of the U.S. military. Demographic and military-specific factors were assessed using administrative personnel records and survey data. Results Of the 9,038 spouses, 4.9% had a probable diagnosis of MDD. In unadjusted models, spouses of service members who deployed and experiencecd combat-related events, were enlisted, had a probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis, or screened positive for alcohol misuse were more likely to screen positive for MDD. In adjusted models, only spouses married to enlisted service members or those with PTSD had increased risk for MDD. Other demographic and military-related factors associated with MDD in spouses included less educational attainment, unemployment, having four or more children, and having prior military service (although not currently serving in the military) in the adjusted models. Conclusions Findings characterize demographic, military, and service member psychological health factors that are associated with depression among military spouses. These findings imply that deployment alone may not negatively affect military spouses, but rather it may be the mental health impact on the service member, especially PTSD that increases the odds for MDD among military spouses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Donoho","given":"Carrie J."},{"family":"LeardMann","given":"Cynthia"},{"family":"O'Malley","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Walter","given":"Kristen H."},{"family":"Riviere","given":"Lyndon A."},{"family":"Curry","given":"John F."},{"family":"Adler","given":"Amy B."}],"citation-key":"donohoetal2018","container-title":"Depression and Anxiety","DOI":"10.1002/da.22820","ISSN":"1520-6394","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"1137-1144","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Depression among military spouses: Demographic, military, and service member psychological health risk factors","title-short":"Depression among military spouses","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/da.22820","volume":"35"},

Thus, extinction consolidation may prevent the memory from undergoing reconsolidation. We investigated whether such an interaction also exists between extinction and reconsolidation of fear memories within the amygdala, by using a within subjects experimental design. We found that inhibition of protein synthesis in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) impaired reconsolidation for both the briefly reactivated and extinguished fear memories suggesting that extinction is not a sufficient condition to prevent induction of reconsolidation in the amygdala.

IFS is also user-friendly; it helps you to comprehend the complexity of your psyche. Dr. Earley shows how IFS is a complete method for psychological healing that you can use on your own.Self-Therapy is also helpful for therapists because it presents the IFS model in such detail that it is a manual for the method.Jay's classes have been life-transforming for me, and this wonderful book is a support for Self-leadership. I often feel heartfelt gratitude at finding myself standing strong after having been guided by Jay through my inner tangle of parts.-- Elizabeth Russell, FloridaJay has a great talent for making complex things easy to understand. The vignettes are very useful in seeing how IFS works in real life, and the help sheets are particularly valuable when you work on yourself.-- Sandy Therry, M.

  {"id":"ecker2015","abstract":"Memory reconsolidation is the brain’s natural, neural process that can produce transformational change: the full, permanent elimination of an acquired behavior or emotional response. This article identifies and examines 10 common misconceptions regarding memory reconsolidation research findings and their translation into clinical practice. The research findings are poised to drive significant advancements in both the theory and practice of psychotherapy, but these benefits depend on an accurate understanding of how memory reconsolidation functions, and misconceptions have been proliferating. This article also proposes a unified model of reconsolidation and extinction phenomena based on the brain’s well-established requirement of memory mismatch (prediction error) for reconsolidation to be triggered. A reinterpretation of numerous studies published without reference to the mismatch requirement shows how the mismatch requirement and mismatch relativity (MRMR) model can account for diverse empirical findings, reveal unrecognized dynamics of memory change, and generate predictions testable by further research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Ecker","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"ecker2015","container-title":"International Journal of Neuropsychotherapy","container-title-short":"IJNPT","DOI":"10.12744/ijnpt.2015.0002-0046","ISSN":"22027653","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2-46","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Memory reconsolidation understood and misunderstood","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.neuropsychotherapist.com/memory-reconsolidation-understood-and-misunderstood/","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"ecker2021","abstract":"The annulment of a human emotional memory through reconsolidation behavioral up- 8 dating has been documented in over twenty laboratory studies since the first such report in 2010. 9 However, fourteen studies have reported non-replication, the cause(s) of which remain unclear. 10 This review examines all successful and unsuccessful studies in detail, in an attempt to identify (a) 11 the specific probable causes of non-replication and (b) how clinical translation might optimally be 12 designed. For analyzing non-replications, a set of criteria is defined for principled identification of 13 specific moments of prediction error (PE) in experimental procedures, including latent cause tran- 14 sitions, based on a preponderance of empirical evidence. A previously overlooked element of ex- 15 perimental procedure is in that way identified as being potentially decisive, and a unified, testable 16 explanation is proposed for behavioral updating successes and failures in terms of the presence or 17 absence of a PE experience. That in turn allows successful studies to be compared for the internal 18 experiences induced in subjects, rather than compared for their external procedures, revealing an 19 invariant set of three experiences shared by all successful updating studies despite their diverse 20 procedures. Clinical translation, defined as replication of those experiences, not any particular pro- 21 cedure, is illustrated by an actual case, one of many published cases that have documented prompt 22 transformational change produced by that specific methodology, suggesting memory reconsolida- 23 tion as the mechanism of change.

  {"id":"eckeretal2012","abstract":"Psychotherapy that regularly yields liberating, lasting change was, in the last century, a futuristic vision, but it has now become reality, thanks to a convergence of remarkable advances in clinical knowledge and brain science. In Unlocking the Emotional Brain, authors Ecker, Ticic and Hulley equip readers to carry out focused, empathic therapy using the process found by researchers to induce memory reconsolidation, the recently discovered and only known process for actually unlocking emotional memory at the synaptic level. Emotional memory's tenacity is the familiar bane of therapists, and researchers have long believed that emotional memory forms indelible learning. Reconsolidation has overturned these views. It allows new learning to erase, not just suppress, the deep, unconscious, intensely problematic emotional learnings that form during childhood or in later tribulations and generate most of the symptoms that bring people to therapy. Readers will learn methods that precisely eliminate unwanted, ingrained emotional responses―whether moods, behaviors or thought patterns―causing no loss of ordinary narrative memory, while restoring clients' well-being. Numerous case examples show the versatile use of this process in AEDP, Coherence Therapy, EFT, EMDR and IPNB.","author":[{"family":"Ecker","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Ticic","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Hulley","given":"Laurel"}],"citation-key":"eckeretal2012","edition":"1st Edition","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,24]]},"publisher":"Routledge","source":"Amazon","title":"Unlocking the Emotional Brain","type":"book"},

We delineate a model of how coherence therapy engages native mental processes that (a) efficiently reveal specific, symptom-generating, unconscious personal constructs in implicit emotional memory and then (b) selectively depotentiate these constructs, ending symptom production. Both the psychological and the neural operation of this methodology are described, particularly how it defines and follows the built-in rules of change of the brain–mind–body system. On neuroscientific grounds, we suggest a fundamental distinction between transformative change, which permanently eliminates symptom-generating constructs and neural circuits, and counteractive change, which creates new constructs and circuits that compete against the symptom-generating ones and is inherently susceptible to relapse. We propose that coherence therapy achieves transformative change through the reconsolidation of memory, a recently discovered form of neuroplasticity, and present evidence consistent with this hypothesis.

Blast-related mild TBI (mTBI) has been of particular concern in the most recent veterans although controversy remains concerning separation of the postconcussion syndrome associated with mTBI from post-traumatic stress disorder. TBI is also a risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD, TBI, and CTE are all associated with chronic inflammation. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genetic loci associated with AD that implicate inflammation and - in particular microglia - as key modulators of the AD- and TBI-related degenerative processes. At the molecular level, recent studies have identified TREM2 and TYROBP/DAP12 as components of a key molecular hub linking inflammation and microglia to the pathophysiology of AD and possibly TBI.

  {"id":"emersonetal2017","abstract":"Background\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder disproportionately impact certain populations including American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIAN). While PTSD and alcohol use disorder have been studied both separately and in tandem, less is known about the association in AIANs. The objective was to examine the association between lifetime PTSD and past year alcohol use disorder among AIANs and non-Hispanic Whites (NHW).\n\nMethods\nData come from the 2012–2013 U.S. National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions–III. We used logistic regression to estimate odds of AUD among adults with and without PTSD by race.\n\nResults\n19,705 participants, of whom 511 were AIAN and 19,194 were NHW, were included in this study. The percentage of PTSD among AIAN was 22.9% (n=117) compared to 11.7% (n=2,251) in NHW (p-value <0.0001). The percentage of past year alcohol use disorder among AIAN was 20.2% (n=103) compared to 14.2% (n=2,725) in NHW (p-value <0.0001). The percentage of comorbid past year alcohol use disorder with lifetime PTSD among AIAN was 6.5% (n=33) compared to 2.4% (n=457) in NHW (p-value <0.0001). Regarding the joint distribution of PTSD and AUD, AIAN men have greater than 3 times the percentage compared to NHW men (9.5% vs. 3.1%). When stratifying by race (after adjusting for age, sex, depression, and education), among AIAN, the odds of past year alcohol use disorder with (vs. without) lifetime PTSD were 1.76 (95% CI 1.07, 2.90) and among NHW, the odds were 1.59 (95% CI 1.41, 1.80).\n\nConclusions\nPTSD is significantly associated with alcohol use disorder in the study populations.

  {"id":"feducciamithoefer2018","abstract":"MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD has recently progressed to Phase 3 clinical trials and received Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. MDMA used as an adjunct during psychotherapy sessions has demonstrated effectiveness and acceptable safety in reducing PTSD symptoms in Phase 2 trials, with durable remission of PTSD diagnosis in 68% of participants. The underlying psychological and neurological mechanisms for the robust effects in mitigating PTSD are being investigated in animal models and in studies of healthy volunteers. This review explores the potential role of memory reconsolidation and fear extinction during MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. MDMA enhances release of monoamines (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine), hormones (oxytocin, cortisol), and other downstream signaling molecules (BDNF) to dynamically modulate emotional memory circuits. By reducing activation in brain regions implicated in the expression of fear- and anxiety-related behaviors, namely the amygdala and insula, and increasing connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus, MDMA may allow for reprocessing of traumatic memories and emotional engagement with therapeutic processes. Based on the pharmacology of MDMA and the available translational literature of memory reconsolidation, fear learning, and PTSD, this review suggests a neurobiological rationale to explain, at least in part, the large effect sizes demonstrated for MDMA in treating PTSD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Feduccia","given":"Allison A."},{"family":"Mithoefer","given":"Michael C."}],"citation-key":"feducciamithoefer2018","container-title":"Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.03.003","ISSN":"0278-5846","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,8]]},"language":"en","page":"221-228","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD: Are memory reconsolidation and fear extinction underlying mechanisms?","title-short":"MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584617308655","volume":"84"},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of transitioning on transgender persons’ sexual preferences and partnerships. Data were collected through an anonymous online survey. Questions focused on timing of gender transition in relation to change in sexual preference. Transgender individuals have a variety of sexual partners, predominantly cisgender, and may change sexual preference when they transition. Transitioning can be associated with having no primary sexual partner, despite past sexual partnerships. Length of time between identifying as transgender and starting the transition might be associated with changing sexual partner preference, particularly in transgender women. The emerging trends of sexual partnerships and changing sexual preferences related to the transition in this study warrant further investigation. These data provide more understanding of the relationship between transitioning and sexual preferences and partnerships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Fein","given":"Lydia A."},{"family":"Salgado","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Sputova","given":"Klara"},{"family":"Estes","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"Medina","given":"Carlos A."}],"citation-key":"feinetal2018","container-title":"Journal of Homosexuality","DOI":"10.1080/00918369.2017.1333808","ISSN":"0091-8369","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,16]]},"page":"659-671","PMID":"28569625","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Sexual Preferences and Partnerships of Transgender Persons Mid- or Post-Transition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2017.1333808","volume":"65"},

How scapegoating is worked through by the group can have a profound impact on whole-group dynamics and functioning. Although some key aspects of scapegoating have been identified in the psychoanalytic literature, the authors urge group leaders to consider systemic and group-level perspectives in depth. This article draws heavily from Yvonne Agazarian’s Systems-Centered Therapy, which provides a practical foundation for anticipating and preventing scapegoating in group therapy. The authors also explore scapegoating through the framework of René Girard’s Mimetic Theory, which offers a compelling anthropological explanation for why human beings scapegoat as well as a description of how scapegoat dynamics evolve in groups. Insights based on Mimetic Theory are integrated with existing interventions to suggest new ways of working through this critical group phenomenon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Finlay","given":"Lisa D."},{"family":"Abernethy","given":"Alexis D."},{"family":"Garrels","given":"Scott R."}],"citation-key":"finlayetal2016","container-title":"International Journal of Group Psychotherapy","DOI":"10.1080/00207284.2015.1106174","ISSN":"0020-7284","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,2]]},"page":"188-204","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Scapegoating in group therapy: Insights from Girard’s Mimetic Theory","title-short":"Scapegoating in group therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00207284.2015.1106174","volume":"66"},

  {"id":"forscheretal2019","abstract":"Using a novel technique known as network meta-analysis, we synthesized evidence from 492 studies (87,418 participants) to investigate the effectiveness of procedures in changing implicit measures, which we define as response biases on implicit tasks. We also evaluated these procedures’ effects on explicit and behavioral measures. We found that implicit measures can be changed, but effects are often relatively weak (|ds| < .30). Most studies focused on producing short-term changes with brief, single-session manipulations. Procedures that associate sets of concepts, invoke goals or motivations, or tax mental resources changed implicit measures the most, whereas procedures that induced threat, affirmation, or specific moods/emotions changed implicit measures the least. Bias tests suggested that implicit effects could be inflated relative to their true population values. Procedures changed explicit measures less consistently and to a smaller degree than implicit measures and generally produced trivial changes in behavior. Finally, changes in implicit measures did not mediate changes in explicit measures or behavior. Our findings suggest that changes in implicit measures are possible, but those changes do not necessarily translate into changes in explicit measures or behavior.

  {"id":"fortneyetal","abstract":"An effectiveness trial found that telemedicine collaborative care for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) significantly increased engagement in trauma-focused psychotherapy (TFP) and improved PTSD symptoms. However, in a subsequent implementation trial, very few veterans enrolled in collaborative care initiated TFP. We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation to determine why veterans did not initiate TFP in the implementation trial. After conducting chart reviews of 1,071 veterans with PTSD enrolled in collaborative care, patients were categorized into four mutually exclusive TFP groups: TFP not discussed; TFP discussed, declined; TFP discussed, did not decline; and TFP initiated. We conducted semistructured interviews with 43 unique patients and 58 unique providers (i.e., care managers and mental health specialists). Almost half (48.6%) of the veterans had no documentation of discussing TFP with their care manager; another 28.9% discussed it but declined. Most veterans (77.1%) had an encounter with a mental health specialist, 36.8% of whom never discussed TFP, and 35.7% of whom discussed it but declined. Providers reported that many veterans were not able, willing, or ready to engage in TFP and that non–trauma-focused therapies were better aligned with their treatment goals. Veterans gave numerous reasons for not initiating TFP, including having bad prior experiences with TFP and wanting to avoid thinking about past traumatic experiences. Commonly cited reasons for noninitiation were providers never discussing TFP with veterans and veterans declining TFP after discussing it with their provider. Interventions, such as shared decision-making tools, may be needed to engage providers and patients in informed discussions about TFP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Fortney","given":"John C."},{"family":"Rajan","given":"Suparna"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jessica A."},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Sarah B."},{"family":"Nolan","given":"John P."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Edwin"},{"family":"Sayre","given":"George"},{"family":"Petrova","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Carol E."},{"family":"Reisinger","given":"Heather S."},{"family":"Schnurr","given":"Paula P."}],"citation-key":"fortneyetal","container-title":"Journal of Traumatic Stress","DOI":"10.1002/jts.22946","ISSN":"1573-6598","issue":"n/a","language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

For the past 15 years, Kate has worked in full-time private practice and now teaches couple therapy using Internal Family Systems Therapy (IFS) around the country and in Europe.\n\nPercy Ballard is an Internal Family Systems Therapy (IFS) psychotherapist practicing full time in Belmont MA. He and Kate lead workshops on implicit bias that help people to find, understand and address subconscious forms of bias (ie sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.). Learn more about Percy’s practice at percyballardmd.com.\n\nWorking with Implicit Bias\nWhat is implicit bias? Percy and Kate discuss the biases we carry unknown to ourselves. Together they look at how implicit bias training can bring awareness to our biases and how they manifest in the world.\n\n“Implicit biases are the little ideas and associations that we have which we are unaware of. The idea that we associate with the concept of being female with rearing a family and the concept of male with having a career. Those are associations that we have from a young age that are in us. We did not put them there. Our environments, the media and people we have been around, have put that in us. We are biologically wired to have these associations.” – Percy Ballard\n\nAn Offensive Defense (16:40)\nThe group looks at why implicit bias exists in the first place. They look at how the mind uses bias as a safety mechanism, as well as how the mind reacts when our implicit bias is called out. How can mindfulness allow us to work with implicit bias?\n\n“To have a biased belief often means to us that we are bad people. So many of us hold that. Those protections keep it out of our awareness or the risk is that we see ourselves as bad.” – Kate Lingren\n\nCalling Out Bias (28:35)\nPercy and Kate do roleplay that offers real-world examples of the complexities of confronting implicit bias. This practice uncovers the social dynamics and behaviors that surface when we are encountering implicit bias in ourselves and in others.

  {"id":"frank2020","abstract":"Understanding what the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy have in common with other forms of therapy helps us identify essential elements of therapeutic change. Several processes that cut across diverse psychotherapy approaches are outlined, based on clinical empiricism, theory, and research. A model of therapeutic action is considered that places emotion schemas at the center of therapeutic change across modalities; to modify these memory structures, diverse therapies utilize overtly different, if complementary, methods. These shared processes are drawn together into a common, coherent change model that is further informed by the role of neuroplastic memory reconsolidation. Although the model seeks to explain and to link multiple transformative therapy approaches, and in that sense, is a general model that applies to many therapies, for the purposes of this paper, the case example applies the model to psychoanalytic therapy. Paradoxically, the case illustration brings into sharpened focus what is important and often underemphasized in psychoanalytic therapy, while also opening and extending customary forms of psychoanalytic and psychotherapeutic thinking and methodology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Frank","given":"Kenneth A."}],"citation-key":"frank2020","container-title":"Psychoanalytic Perspectives","DOI":"10.1080/1551806X.2020.1801040","ISSN":"1551-806X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,1]]},"page":"289-317","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Rethinking Therapeutic Action: Finding Commonalty in Diversity","title-short":"Rethinking Therapeutic Action","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1551806X.2020.1801040","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"fullenetal2020","abstract":"Medicare insures a growing number of individuals who may benefit from mental health services. Medicare mental health provider policy, last updated in 1989, excludes a significant proportion of the master’s-level mental health workforce, resulting in what has been described as the Medicare mental health coverage gap (MMHCG; Fullen, Wiley, & Morgan, 2019). Based on existing provider shortages in rural areas, Medicare provider policy may be particularly burdensome for accessing care in rural areas. The authors analyzed MMHCG data from 3,760 counselors, including 601 who reside in Health Resources & Services Administration-designated rural localities. A total of 78.0% (n = 469) of rural counselors reported being directly impacted by the MMHCG, compared with 68.6% (n = 2,167) of nonrural counselors (χ² = 21.47, p pro bono services (χ² = 11.05, p < .001, OR = 1.35, 95% CI [1.13, 1.61]) due to the MMHCG.

  {"id":"fullenetal2022","abstract":"Mental health conditions are relatively common among Medicare beneﬁciaries. Yet, Medicare provider eligibility was last updated in 1989, raising concerns about beneﬁciaries’ access to mental health care in the United States. Beneﬁciaries are currently restricted from accessing mental health services provided by licensed professional counselors and licensed marriage and family therapists. Little is known about the impact of this Medicare mental health coverage gap (MMHCG) on Medicare beneﬁciaries. Hermeneutic phenomenology was used to analyze semistructured interviews with 18 beneﬁciaries who had attempted to access mental health care but were limited due to the MMHCG. Three themes emerged: (a) exasperating experiences with the MMHCG, (b) the MMHCG compounds barriers to mental health care, and (c) Medicare as a ﬂawed system. These ﬁndings suggest current Medicare mental health policy interferes with beneﬁciaries’ access to needed mental health services.

  {"id":"garciaetal2014","abstract":"Background and purpose\nWhat factors influence transgender men’s decisions to undergo (and to not undergo) specific genital gender confirming surgeries (GCS) has not been described in the literature. Sexual function outcomes related to clitoral transposition and penile prosthesis placement is also not well described. Durability of neophallus dimensions after phalloplasty has not been described. A better understanding of these factors is necessary for pre-op counseling. We sought to assess patient genital-GCS related satisfaction, regret, pre/post-op sexual function, genital preferences, and genital measurements post-op.\n\nMaterials and methods\nWe evaluated ten female to male transgender patients who had previously undergone suprapubic pedicle-flap phalloplasty [suprapubic phalloplasty (SP); N=10] and 15 who had undergone radial artery forearm-flap phalloplasty [(RAP); N=15; 5/15 without and 10/15 with cutaneous nerve to clitoral nerve anastomosis] at our center (UK). We queried patients’ surgery related preferences and concerns, satisfaction, and sexual function pre/post-surgery, and accounted for whether patients had undergone clitoral transposition and/or cutaneous-to-clitoral nerve anastomosis. We measured flaccid and (where applicable) erect length and girth using a smart-phone app we designed.\n\nResults\nMean age at surgery and follow-up for those that underwent SP was 35.1 and 2.23 years, and 34 and 6.8 for those that underwent RAP. Mean satisfaction scores were 9.1/10 and 9/10 for those that underwent SP and RAP, respectively. No patient (0%) regretted starting genital-GCS surgery. All (100%) patients that could achieve orgasm before GCS with clitoral transposition could achieve orgasm after surgery, and the vast majority reported preserved quality of erogenous sensation by our transposition technique. All (100%) RAP and 9/10 SP patients reported masturbation with their phallus. Inflatable penile prosthesis placement was not associated with decreased erogenous sensation/orgasm. Penile dimensions were relatively stable through follow-up for both groups. Our App length measurements correlated with a ruler within ±<4.5%.\n\nConclusions\nFemale-to-male genital-GCS offered in 3-stages was associated with high overall satisfaction and no regret among our sample. Sexual function appears to be preserved after both clitoral transposition and inflatable prosthesis placement, and consolidation of erogenous sensation to the phallus was described as important to all subjects. Discussion of patient’s pre-op sexual function, as well as specific concerns and preferences related to specific genital-GCS surgeries is important.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Garcia","given":"Maurice M."},{"family":"Christopher","given":"Nim A."},{"family":"De Luca","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Spilotros","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Ralph","given":"David J."}],"citation-key":"garciaetal2014","container-title":"Translational Andrology and Urology","container-title-short":"Transl Androl Urol","DOI":"10.3978/j.issn.2223-4683.2014.04.10","ISSN":"2223-4691","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,6]]},"page":"156-162","PMCID":"PMC4708164","PMID":"26816764","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Overall satisfaction, sexual function, and the durability of neophallus dimensions following staged female to male genital gender confirming surgery: the Institute of Urology, London U.K. experience","title-short":"Overall satisfaction, sexual function, and the durability of neophallus dimensions following staged female to male genital gender confirming surgery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4708164/","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"garciaetal2021","abstract":"Nurses may experience frequent nightmares due to stressful work environments. Nightmares may also exacerbate stress among nurses, although this has yet to be tested empirically. We examined daily bidirectional associations between stress severity and nightmares, and moderation by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. 392 nurses (92% female; 78% White) completed 14 days of sleep diaries to assess previous-day stress severity and nightmare occurrence and severity. PTSD symptoms were assessed at baseline. Multilevel models were used to examine bidirectional, within-person associations between daily stress and nightmares, and cross-level moderation by baseline PTSD symptoms. 47.2% of nurses reported at least one nightmare across the two weeks. Days with greater stress were associated with higher odds of experiencing a nightmare (OR = 1.22, p = 0.001), as well as greater nightmare severity (b = 0.09, p = 0.033). Nightmare occurrence was associated with greater next-day stress severity (b = 0.15, p < 0.001). Daily stress and nightmare associations were similar for those with and without PTSD symptoms. Nightmares and stress may occur in a bidirectional fashion. Nurses face intense occupational demands and frequent exposure to potentially traumatic events. Studies should explore whether targeting nightmares and stress may improve nurses' health and well-being.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Garcia","given":"Odalis"},{"family":"Slavish","given":"Danica C."},{"family":"Dietch","given":"Jessica R."},{"family":"Messman","given":"Brett A."},{"family":"Contractor","given":"Ateka A."},{"family":"Haynes","given":"Patricia L."},{"family":"Pruiksma","given":"Kristi E."},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Ruggero","given":"Camilo"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Daniel J."}],"citation-key":"garciaetal2021","container-title":"Stress and Health","DOI":"10.1002/smi.3048","ISSN":"1532-2998","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"1035-1042","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"What goes around comes around: Nightmares and daily stress are bidirectionally associated in nurses","title-short":"What goes around comes around","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.3048","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"gerge2020","abstract":"Some reflections are given on neuroplasticity and traumatization. Today, we know that the verbal narrative of a traumatic event rarely is sufficient to resolve more complex mental traumatization. The ultimate goal of phase-oriented trauma therapy (Herman, 1992) is integration of the often-fragmented sensory and emotional elements of nonverbal memory. Otherwise, the nonverbal experience fragments may remain for many years after traumatic experiences, sometimes lifelong. Therefore, it is important that psychotherapy activates curiosity and joy and at the same time soothes and lowers feelings of fear, shame, self-hatred and suspicion. We need to offer methods that lead to more stable windows of tolerance (Siegel, 1999) and activate positive states and resources. Then patients can be active and investigative and thus can change their brains and their lives. How the posttraumatic conditions can be eased and ultimately healed is reflected on in relation to the neurofeedback (Niv, 2013; Kirk et al., 2016), as an example of a method aiming at implicit regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerge","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"gerge2020","container-title":"European Journal of Trauma & Dissociation","container-title-short":"European Journal of Trauma & Dissociation","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejtd.2020.100164","ISSN":"2468-7499","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100164","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What neuroscience and neurofeedback can teach psychotherapists in the fieid of complex trauma: Interoception, neuroception and the embodiment of unspeakable events in treatment of complex PTSD, dissociative disorders and childhood traumatization","title-short":"What neuroscience and neurofeedback can teach psychotherapists in the fieid of complex trauma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246874992030034X","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"gershmanetal2017","abstract":"Retrieving a memory can modify its influence on subsequent behavior. We develop a computational theory of memory modification, according to which modification of a memory trace occurs through classical associative learning, but which memory trace is eligible for modification depends on a structure learning mechanism that discovers the units of association by segmenting the stream of experience into statistically distinct clusters (latent causes). New memories are formed when the structure learning mechanism infers that a new latent cause underlies current sensory observations. By the same token, old memories are modified when old and new sensory observations are inferred to have been generated by the same latent cause. We derive this framework from probabilistic principles, and present a computational implementation. Simulations demonstrate that our model can reproduce the major experimental findings from studies of memory modification in the Pavlovian conditioning literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Gershman","given":"Samuel J"},{"family":"Monfils","given":"Marie-H"},{"family":"Norman","given":"Kenneth A"},{"family":"Niv","given":"Yael"}],"citation-key":"gershmanetal2017","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.23763","editor":[{"family":"Frank","given":"Michael J"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,15]]},"page":"e23763","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"The computational nature of memory modification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23763","volume":"6"},

Ambiguous terminology hinders cross-study comparisons and confounds interpretation of the suggested role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in schema functions. Based on an extensive review of the psychological literature, we propose a framework for distinguishing memory schemas from other knowledge structures. The framework includes a definition of schema as possessing four necessary and sufficient features, and four additional features schemas are sensitive to, which are not required but do play a frequent and central role in schema functions. Necessary schema features are (1) an associative network structure, (2) basis on multiple episodes, (3) lack of unit detail, and (4) adaptability. Features schemas are sensitive to are (5) chronological relationships, (6) hierarchical organization, (7) cross-connectivity, and (8) embedded response options. Additionally, we suggest that vmPFC activity observed in studies of schemas corresponds with participants' coordination of existing schemas with ongoing task demands.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Vanessa E."},{"family":"Gilboa","given":"Asaf"}],"citation-key":"ghoshgilboa2014","container-title":"Neuropsychologia","container-title-short":"Neuropsychologia","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.11.010","ISSN":"0028-3932","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"104-114","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What is a memory schema?

  {"id":"giesinger2019","abstract":"In liberal ethics, it is generally assumed that adults are autonomous and independent, whereas children are non-autonomous, dependent and vulnerable. It has been pointed out, however, that all persons are vulnerable. This view seems to blur the distinction between childhood and adulthood. In this essay, I discuss whether introducing a notion of universal vulnerability really undermines the common liberal view on childhood and adulthood. My main claim is that this is not the case: even if all persons are vulnerable, children must still be seen as specially vulnerable. I make clear that the attempt to elucidate the special vulnerability of children leads back to a distinction between children and adults that is based on the concepts of autonomy and independence. For the purpose of this argument, I develop a two-level notion of vulnerability. Against this background, I further argue that while the classical distinction between childhood and adulthood should be maintained, there is reason to reconsider what it means to be an adult or a child. I also claim that some forms of vulnerability in children are worth being cultivated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Giesinger","given":"Johannes"}],"citation-key":"giesinger2019","container-title":"Ethics and Social Welfare","container-title-short":"Ethics and Social Welfare","DOI":"10.1080/17496535.2019.1647262","ISSN":"1749-6535, 1749-6543","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,3]]},"language":"en","page":"216-229","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Vulnerability and Autonomy – Children and Adults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2019.1647262","volume":"13"},

Since 2000, a comparable protein-dependent re-stabilization phase, called reconsolidation, has been assumed to take place after memory retrieval. This consolidation/reconsolidation hypothesis, has dominated the literature for more than 50 years, despite compelling evidence that is inconsistent with it. In this review, we present an historical overview and explain how, despite serious criticisms, this hypothesis has persisted for decades and become accepted as a dogma. Based on both older and more recent evidence, we next propose the concept of memory integration which involves the linkage or embedding of new material into an already existing representation. We believe integration provides a viable explanation for retrograde amnesia in place of the consolidation/reconsolidation hypothesis. Integration can further be the basis for several major cases of memory alteration such as time dependent memory enhancement, interference, counter-conditioning, updating and other instances of memory malleability. In a final section we consider the implications this new concept may have for memory processes and its translational applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gisquet-Verrier","given":"Pascale"},{"family":"Riccio","given":"David C."}],"citation-key":"gisquet-verrierriccio2018","container-title":"Progress in Neurobiology","container-title-short":"Progress in Neurobiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.pneurobio.2018.10.002","ISSN":"0301-0082","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"15-31","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Memory integration: an alternative to the consolidation/reconsolidation hypothesis","title-short":"Memory integration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008217302174","volume":"171"},

Mean lifetime prevalence of alcohol use in all countries combined was 80%, ranging from 3.8% to 97.1%. Combined average population lifetime and 12-month prevalence of AUDs were 8.6% and 2.2% respectively and 10.7% and 4.4% among non-abstainers. Of individuals with a lifetime AUD, 43.9% had at least one lifetime MHD and 17.9% of respondents with a lifetime MHD had a lifetime AUD. For most comorbidity combinations, the MHD preceded the onset of the AUD. AUD prevalence was much higher for men than women. 15% of all lifetime AUD cases developed before age 18. Higher household income and being older at time of interview, married, and more educated, were associated with a lower risk for lifetime AUD and AUD persistence.\n\nConclusions\nPrevalence of alcohol use and AUD is high overall, with large variation worldwide.

To our knowledge, no studies have examined whether manifestations of racial/ethnic discrimination increase risk of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder (AUD) severity levels.\nMethods: Analyses were conducted among 17,115 racial/ethnic minority respondents of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol-Related Conditions III (NESARC-III), a cross-sectional survey ﬁelded in 2012−2013. We used multinomial logistic regression to examine the associations between measures of racial/ ethnic discrimination and past-year AUD severity levels following the DSM-5 deﬁnition, while adjusting for poverty thresholds set by the U.S. Census Bureau, and race/ethnicity (American Indian or Alaskan Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Other Paciﬁc Islander; Black or African American; Hispanic or Latino). We also evaluated whether associations between discrimination and AUD severity varied by poverty status and race/ethnicity.\nResults: Covariate-adjusted multinomial logistic regressions suggested that in comparison to those who did not experience discrimination, those who experienced discrimination had a 1.5-fold greater risk of mild AUD, a 1.6fold greater risk of moderate AUD, and a 2.3-fold greater risk of severe AUD. We found no evidence to suggest that the strength of the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and AUD severity varied across race/ ethnic group or poverty status.\nConclusions: Experience of racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with greater AUD severity in the U.S. regardless of one’s speciﬁc racial/ethnic group membership or poverty status. Strategies to reduce risk for severe AUD should include eﬀorts to minimize the occurrence and impact of interpersonal and institutional racism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Glass","given":"Joseph E."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Emily C."},{"family":"Oh","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"glassetal2020","container-title":"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","container-title-short":"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108203","ISSN":"03768716","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11]]},"language":"en","page":"108203","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Racial/ethnic discrimination and alcohol use disorder severity among United States adults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871620303689","volume":"216"},

We sent four (two pairs of fictitious man–woman) résumés to 1,372 job offers from a broad selection of occupations. In one pair, candidates had equivalent curriculum vitae (CVs) except for their sex and their qualifications (meeting standards or higher). In the second pair, candidates differed by sex and parenthood status (with or without children). We interpret the observed differences in favour of men as signalling gender bias in recruitment. This bias is reduced when women have higher qualifications and increases when they have children. We interpret employers’ openness to modify their decisions when candidates’ personal characteristics differ from the group norm, and the absence of discrimination among highly qualified non-mothers, as evidence that gender bias in recruitment is largely grounded in employers’ stereotypes rather than in prejudices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"González","given":"M José"},{"family":"Cortina","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Rodríguez","given":"Jorge"}],"citation-key":"gonzalezetal2019","container-title":"European Sociological Review","container-title-short":"European Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1093/esr/jcy055","ISSN":"0266-7215","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"page":"187-204","source":"Silverchair","title":"The Role of Gender Stereotypes in Hiring: A Field Experiment","title-short":"The Role of Gender Stereotypes in Hiring","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcy055","volume":"35"},

Further work to understand the causes of these disparities must be undertaken, which can then help inform the development of interventions to reduce and eradicate racial disparities in health care provision.\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate racial differences in analgesia administration, and particularly opioid administration, among children diagnosed as having appendicitis.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nRepeated cross-sectional study of patients aged 21 years or younger evaluated in the emergency department who had an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis of appendicitis, using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2003 to 2010. We calculated the frequency of both opioid and nonopioid analgesia administration using complex survey weighting. We then performed multivariable logistic regression to examine racial differences in overall administration of analgesia, and specifically opioid analgesia, after adjusting for important demographic and visit covariates, including ethnicity and pain score.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nReceipt of analgesia administration (any and opioid) by race.\n\nRESULTS\nAn estimated 0.94 (95% CI, 0.78–1.10) million children were diagnosed as having appendicitis. Of those, 56.8% (95% CI, 49.8%–63.9%) received analgesia of any type; 41.3% (95% CI, 33.7%–48.9%) received opioid analgesia (20.7% [95% CI, 5.3%–36.0%] of black patients vs 43.1% [95% CI, 34.6%–51.4%] of white patients). When stratified by pain score and adjusted for ethnicity, black patients with moderate pain were less likely to receive any analgesia than white patients (adjusted odds ratio = 0.1 [95% CI, 0.02–0.8]). Among those with severe pain, black patients were less likely to receive opioids than white patients (adjusted odds ratio = 0.2 [95% CI, 0.06–0.9]). In a multivariable model, there were no significant differences in the overall rate of analgesia administration by race. However, black patients received opioid analgesia significantly less frequently than white patients (12.2% [95% CI, 0.1%–35.2%] vs 33.9% [95% CI, 0.6%–74.9%], respectively; adjusted odds ratio = 0.2 [95% CI, 0.06–0.8]).\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAppendicitis pain is undertreated in pediatrics, and racial disparities with respect to analgesia administration exist. Black children are less likely to receive any pain medication for moderate pain and less likely to receive opioids for severe pain, suggesting a different threshold for treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Goyal","given":"Monika K."},{"family":"Kuppermann","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Cleary","given":"Sean D."},{"family":"Teach","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Chamberlain","given":"James M."}],"citation-key":"goyaletal2015","container-title":"JAMA pediatrics","container-title-short":"JAMA Pediatr","DOI":"10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1915","ISSN":"2168-6203","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11]]},"page":"996-1002","PMCID":"PMC4829078","PMID":"26366984","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Racial Disparities in Pain Management of Children With Appendicitis in Emergency Departments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4829078/","volume":"169"},

Data were collected from April 2012 through June 2013 and analyzed in October 2014.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nTwelve-month and lifetime prevalences of AUD.\n\nRESULTS\nTwelve-month and lifetime prevalences of AUD were 13.9% and 29.1%, respectively. Prevalence was generally highest for men (17.6% and 36.0%, respectively), white (14.0% and 32.6%, respectively) and Native American (19.2% and 43.4%, respectively), respondents, and younger (26.7% and 37.0%, respectively) and previously married (11.4% and 27.1%, respectively) or never married (25.0% and 35.5%, respectively) adults. Prevalence of 12-month and lifetime severe AUD was greatest among respondents with the lowest income level (1.8% and 1.5%, respectively). Significant disability was associated with 12-month and lifetime AUD and increased with the severity of AUD. Only 19.8% of respondents with lifetime AUD were ever treated. Significant associations were found between 12-month and lifetime AUD and other substance use disorders, major depressive and bipolar I disorders, and antisocial and borderline personality disorders across all levels of AUD severity, with odds ratios ranging from 1.2 (95% CI, 1.08-1.36) to 6.4 (95% CI, 5.76-7.22). Associations between AUD and panic disorder, specific phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder were modest (odds ratios ranged from 1.2 (95% CI, 1.01-1.43) to 1.4 (95% CI, 1.13-1.67) across most levels of AUD severity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAlcohol use disorder defined by DSM-5 criteria is a highly prevalent, highly comorbid, disabling disorder that often goes untreated in the United States. The NESARC-III data indicate an urgent need to educate the public and policy makers about AUD and its treatment alternatives, to destigmatize the disorder, and to encourage those who cannot reduce their alcohol consumption on their own, despite substantial harm to themselves and others, to seek treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Grant","given":"Bridget F."},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Risë B."},{"family":"Saha","given":"Tulshi D."},{"family":"Chou","given":"S.

  {"id":"grummittetal2022","abstract":"Background: Childhood neglect is a risk factor for subsequent mental health problems. However, research on the unique contribution of emotional and physical subtypes of neglect is lacking. Importantly, if emotional and physical neglect have different impacts on mental health, they must be examined separately to understand how to prevent and treat their effects.\nObjective: This study aimed to examine associations of emotional and physical neglect with depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol and drug use in 18- to 20-year-olds.\nMethods: Participants (N = 569, mean age = 18.9, 70% female) responded in an online survey to questions on childhood emotional and physical neglect, childhood abuse, symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and alcohol and drug use and problems. Procedures were approved by the University of Sydney Human Ethics Committee. Hierarchical linear regressions were performed, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and other adverse childhood experiences.\nResults: Combined neglect was associated with depression (B = 2.895, p < 0.001), anxiety (B = 1.572, p = 0.003) and stress (B = 1.781, p = 0.001). However, a second model entering emotional and physical neglect as separate exposures revealed emotional neglect was driving this association with depression (B = 2.884, p < 0.001), anxiety (B = 1.627, p = 0.001) and stress (B = 1.776, p = 0.001), and that physical neglect was not associated with any outcome. Neither emotional nor physical neglect were associated with alcohol or drug use.\nConclusion: Emotional neglect is a risk factor for mental health problems in early adulthood. Research that combines emotional and physical neglect into a single exposure may be obscuring relationships with mental health.

Design: A semistructured interview guide was used with three focus groups of AI/AN patients in the U.S. Southwest and Pacific Northwest regions to explore pain and CBPM in AI/ANs. Findings: The participants provided rich qualitative data regarding chronic pain and willingness to use CBPM. Themes included empty promises and health care insufficiencies, individuality, pain management strategies, and suggestions for health care providers. Conclusion: Results suggest that there is room for improvement in chronic pain care among AI/ANs and that CBPM would likely be a viable and culturally appropriate approach for chronic pain management.

  {"id":"hardtetal2010","abstract":"There are two research traditions on dynamic memory processes. In cognitive psychology, the malleable nature of long-term memory has been extensively documented. Distortions, such as the misinformation effect or hindsight bias, illustrate that memories can be easily changed, often without their owner taking notice. On the other hand, effects like hypermnesia demonstrate that memory might be more reliable than these distortions suggest. In the neuroscience field, similar observations were obtained mostly from animal studies. Research on memory consolidation suggested that memories become progressively resistant to amnesic treatments over time, but the reconsolidation phenomenon showed that this stability can be transiently lifted when these memories are reactivated, i.e., retrieved. Surprisingly, both research traditions have not taken much notice of each others' advances in understanding memory dynamics. We apply concepts developed in neuroscience to phenomena revealed in cognitive psychology to illustrate how these twins separated at birth may be reunited again.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hardt","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Einarsson","given":"Einar Örn"},{"family":"Nader","given":"Karim"}],"citation-key":"hardtetal2010","container-title":"Annual Review of Psychology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100455","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"141-167","PMID":"19575608","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"A Bridge Over Troubled Water: Reconsolidation as a Link Between Cognitive and Neuroscientific Memory Research Traditions","title-short":"A Bridge Over Troubled Water","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100455","volume":"61"},
  {"id":"hardwickeetal2016","abstract":"Reconsolidation theory proposes that retrieval can destabilize an existing memory trace, opening a time-dependent window during which that trace is amenable to modification. Support for the theory is largely drawn from nonhuman animal studies that use invasive pharmacological or electroconvulsive interventions to disrupt a putative postretrieval restabilization (“reconsolidation”) process. In human reconsolidation studies, however, it is often claimed that postretrieval new learning can be used as a means of “updating” or “rewriting” existing memory traces. This proposal warrants close scrutiny because the ability to modify information stored in the memory system has profound theoretical, clinical, and ethical implications. The present study aimed to replicate and extend a prominent 3-day motor-sequence learning study [Walker MP, Brakefield T, Hobson JA, Stickgold R (2003) Nature 425(6958):616–620] that is widely cited as a convincing demonstration of human reconsolidation. However, in four direct replication attempts (n = 64), we did not observe the critical impairment effect that has previously been taken to indicate disruption of an existing motor memory trace. In three additional conceptual replications (n = 48), we explored the broader validity of reconsolidation-updating theory by using a declarative recall task and sequences similar to phone numbers or computer passwords. Rather than inducing vulnerability to interference, memory retrieval appeared to aid the preservation of existing sequence knowledge relative to a no-retrieval control group. These findings suggest that memory retrieval followed by new learning does not reliably induce human memory updating via reconsolidation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hardwicke","given":"Tom E."},{"family":"Taqi","given":"Mahdi"},{"family":"Shanks","given":"David R."}],"citation-key":"hardwickeetal2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1601440113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,10]]},"language":"en","license":"©  . http://www.pnas.org/preview_site/misc/userlicense.xhtml","page":"5206-5211","PMID":"27114514","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Postretrieval new learning does not reliably induce human memory updating via reconsolidation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5206","volume":"113"},

  {"id":"harrowetal2022","abstract":"Background. Studies that examine course and outcome in psychosis have reported considerable heterogeneity in terms of recovery, remission, employment, symptom presentation, social outcomes, and antipsychotic medication effects. Even with demonstrated heterogeneity in course and outcome, prophylactic antipsychotic maintenance therapy remains the prominent practice, particularly in participants with schizophrenia. Lack of efficacy in maintenance antipsychotic treatment and concerns over health detriments gives cause to re-examine guidelines.\nMethods. This study was conducted as part of the Chicago follow-up study designed as a naturalistic prospective longitudinal research study to investigate the course, outcome, symptomatology, and effects of antipsychotic medication on recovery and rehospitalization in participants with serious mental illness disorders. A total of 139 participants with 734 observations were included in the analysis. GEE logistic models were applied to adjust for confounding factors measured at index hospitalization and follow-ups.\nResults. Our data show that the majority of participants with schizophrenia or affective psychosis experience future episodes of psychosis at some point during the 20-year follow-up. There was a significant diagnostic difference between groups showing an increase in the number of future episodes of psychosis in participants with schizophrenia. Participants with schizophrenia not on antipsychotics after the first 2 years have better outcomes than participants prescribed antipsychotics. The adjusted odds ratio of not on antipsychotic medication was 5.989 (95% CI 3.588–9.993) for recovery and 0.134 (95% CI 0.070–0.259) for rehospitalization. That is, regardless of diagnosis, after the second year, the absence of antipsychotics predicted a higher probability of recovery and lower probability of rehospitalization at subsequent follow-ups after adjusting for confounders.\nConclusion. This study reports multiple findings that bring into question the use of continuous antipsychotic medications, regardless of diagnosis. Even when the confound by indication for prescribing antipsychotic medication is controlled for, participants with schizophrenia and affective psychosis do better than their medicated cohorts, strongly confirming the importance of exposing the role of aiDSP and antipsychotic drug resistance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Harrow","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Jobe","given":"Thomas H"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Liping"}],"citation-key":"harrowetal2022","container-title":"Psychological Medicine","container-title-short":"Psychol.

  {"id":"hartmangolub1999","abstract":"Early news coverage of the rapid expansions and horrors associated with use of crack in the mid-1980s led to a great panic. Scholarly research subsequently debunked the various myths emanating from this media scare. This article examines whether this expanded understanding was reflected in the quality of news coverage over time through a comprehensive examination of all articles about crack cocaine appearing in the New York Times, Time, and Newsweek from 1985 through 1995. It was found that later news stories were generally less blatant, but overall did not correct for previous exaggerations. The long-term perspective also revealed an insidious bias in news coverage through its focus on the innercity, in spite of broader use of crack. This misleading view of “the problem” constructed by the media probably helped divert attention from persistent structural problems facing the inner-city. Scholars and activists need to continue their efforts to focus attention on the underlying social problems to counteract the media's propensity to focus on what might more appropriately be termed symptoms, such as the “crack epidemic.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hartman","given":"Donna M."},{"family":"Golub","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"hartmangolub1999","container-title":"Journal of Psychoactive Drugs","DOI":"10.1080/02791072.1999.10471772","ISSN":"0279-1072","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,10,1]]},"page":"423-433","PMID":"10681109","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The social construction of the crack epidemic in the print media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.1999.10471772","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"heckeretal2019","abstract":"Child maltreatment is known to engender negative emotional and behavioral consequences. Although neglect is the most frequent form of maltreatment, it has thus far only received little attention, especially when looking at low-resource countries. The current study investigated possible associations between neglect and internalizing and externalizing problems. As neglect and abuse often co-occur, the latter was controlled for. In total, 409 Tanzanian primary school students (52% boys, M ¼ 10.5 years, range ¼ 6–15) participated in the cross-sectional study. Structured clinical interviews were conducted assessing maltreatment, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. Overall, 31% (n ¼ 128) of the children reported at least one type of physical neglect and 31% (n ¼ 127) of emotional neglect. Using structural equation modeling, we found a significant association between neglect and internalizing (b ¼ 0.59, p , .01) and externalizing problems (b ¼ 0.35, p , .05). However, these associations could only be detected in younger children (ages 6–9), whereas in older children (ages 10–15), mental health problems were significantly related to violence and abuse. Our findings suggest that the current age may influence the association between maltreatment type and the development of internalizing and/or externalizing problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hecker","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Boettcher","given":"Victoria S."},{"family":"Landolt","given":"Markus A."},{"family":"Hermenau","given":"Katharin"}],"citation-key":"heckeretal2019","container-title":"Development and Psychopathology","container-title-short":"Dev Psychopathol","DOI":"10.1017/S0954579417001882","ISSN":"0954-5794, 1469-2198","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"language":"en","page":"325-339","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Child neglect and its relation to emotional and behavioral problems: A cross-sectional study of primary school-aged children in Tanzania","title-short":"Child neglect and its relation to emotional and behavioral problems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0954579417001882/type/journal_article","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"henryetal2015","abstract":"Family resilience has progressed through two waves and is poised for Wave 3. During Waves 1 and 2, family resilience perspectives were conceptualized, researched, and applied as a strengths-based approach focused on positive family adaptation despite significant risk using an integration of concepts from individual resilience, general systems perspectives on families, and family stress theory. For Wave 3, the authors advocate for increased consistency in terminology and present the family resilience model (FRM) within which existing models interface with family adaptive systems (meaning systems, emotion systems, control systems, maintenance systems, and family stress-response systems). The authors also argue for increased focus on trajectories and cascades, and enhanced prevention, intervention, and policy. The authors provide a hypothetical case study applying the FRM.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Henry","given":"Carolyn S."},{"family":"Sheffield Morris","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Harrist","given":"Amanda W."}],"citation-key":"henryetal2015","container-title":"Family Relations","DOI":"10.1111/fare.12106","ISSN":"1741-3729","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"22-43","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Family resilience: moving into the third wave","title-short":"Family resilience","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fare.12106","volume":"64"},

This pilot research explores effectiveness of a novel intervention, Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy, for treatment of PTSD and associated symptoms and problems, including depression, dissociation, somatization, affect dysregulation, and disrupted self-perception (i.e. shame/guilt) among adults exposed to multiple childhood trauma. Seventeen adults with PTSD and history of multiple childhood traumas participated in an uncontrolled trial of IFS, receiving 16, 90min IFS sessions and completing four evaluations (pre-, mid-, and post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up) asses­ sing PTSD symptoms and diagnosis, as well as multiple secondary outcomes (e.g., symptoms of depression, disso­ ciation, and somatization, affect dysregulation, disrupted self-perception, interoceptive awareness, and selfcompassion). Intent-to-treat analyses using multilevel growth curve modeling and examination of effect sizes demonstrated significant decreases in symptoms of PTSD (d = −4.46 and −3.05 as measured by the CAPS and DTS respectively), associated features of PTSD (e.g., total score on a measure of dissociation, somatization, affect dysregu­ lation, self-perception; d = −1.27), and depression (d = −1.51) across the study period. A medium effect size in the expected direction was observed for self-compassion (d = .72). Small to large effect sizes in the expected direc­ tion were observed for multiple indicators of interoceptive awareness (range d = .27–1.21).

The goal of this review was to provide a comprehensive survey of meta-analyses examining the efficacy of CBT. We identified 269 meta-analytic studies and reviewed of those a representative sample of 106 meta-analyses examining CBT for the following problems: substance use disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, depression and dysthymia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders, insomnia, personality disorders, anger and aggression, criminal behaviors, general stress, distress due to general medical conditions, chronic pain and fatigue, distress related to pregnancy complications and female hormonal conditions. Additional meta-analytic reviews examined the efficacy of CBT for various problems in children and elderly adults. The strongest support exists for CBT of anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, bulimia, anger control problems, and general stress. Eleven studies compared response rates between CBT and other treatments or control conditions. CBT showed higher response rates than the comparison conditions in seven of these reviews and only one review reported that CBT had lower response rates than comparison treatments. In general, the evidence-base of CBT is very strong. However, additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of CBT for randomized-controlled studies. Moreover, except for children and elderly populations, no meta-analytic studies of CBT have been reported on specific subgroups, such as ethnic minorities and low income samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofmann","given":"Stefan G."},{"family":"Asnaani","given":"Anu"},{"family":"Vonk","given":"Imke J.

  {"id":"holmbergetal2019","abstract":"Sexuality is important for most cisgender as well as transgender persons and is an essential aspect of quality of life. For both the patient and their clinicians, managing gender dysphoria includes establishing a comfortable relationship with sexual health issues, which can evolve throughout the course of gender-affirming treatment. Gender-a ffirming endocrine treatment of transgender men and women has considerable effects on sex drive and sexual function. Gender-a ffirming surgery (GAS) can improve body satisfaction and ease gender dysphoria, but surgery itself can be associated with sexual sequelae associated with physical constraints of the new genitals or postsurgical pain, psychological difficulties with accepting the new body , or social aspects of having changed gender. In general, a positive body image is associated with better sexual function and satisfaction, but satisfaction with sexual function after GAS can be present despite dissatisfaction with the surgery and vice versa. Factors involved in the integrated experience of gender-a ffirming treatment and the way in which sexuality is perceived are complex, and supporting sexuality and improving sexual function in transgender patients is, correspondingly , multifaceted. As the transgender patient moves through their life before, during, and after gender-affirming treatment, sexuality and sexual function should be considered and maximized at all stages in order to improve quality of life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Holmberg","given":"Mats"},{"family":"Arver","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Dhejne","given":"Cecilia"}],"citation-key":"holmbergetal2019","container-title":"Nature Reviews Urology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Urol","DOI":"10.1038/s41585-018-0108-8","ISSN":"1759-4812, 1759-4820","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"language":"en","page":"121-139","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Supporting sexuality and improving sexual function in transgender persons","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41585-018-0108-8","volume":"16"},

This is due to the development of innovative behavioural measures that have revealed aspects of our cognitions which may not be identified on self-report measures requiring individuals to reflect on and report their attitudes and beliefs. But what does it mean to characterise such biases as implicit? Can we satisfactorily articulate the grounds for identifying them as bias? And crucially, what sorts of cognitions are in fact being measured; what mental states or processes underpin such behavioural responses? In this paper, we outline some of the philosophical and empirical issues engaged when attempting to address these three questions.

However, within-race differences (e.g., skin tone, Afrocentric features) can lead to variation in these decisions. In addition to phenotypical variation, ethnicity cues (e.g., perceived country of origin, name) may be important within-race factors influencing the perception and evaluations of Black job applicants. Using a resume evaluation paradigm, participants evaluated one of three resumes in which the target applicant’s name provided cues about ethnicity (either Black American, Black African, or White American). Results suggest that Black Americans may experience more discrimination in hiring and are generally perceived less positively across several employment-related domains than both White and Black African applicants. Specifically, we find that Black Americans are less likely to be selected for an interview or offered a job and are evaluated more negatively overall relative to Black Africans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Howard","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Borgella","given":"Alex M."}],"citation-key":"howardborgella2020","container-title":"The Journal of Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/00224545.2019.1687415","ISSN":"0022-4545","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,3]]},"page":"509-519","PMID":"31675282","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Are Adewale and Ngochi more employable than Jamal and Lakeisha?

  {"id":"howardetal2022","abstract":"Emerging evidence suggests that harmful exposures during military service, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), may contribute to mental health, chronic disease, and mortality risks.To assess the mortality rates and estimate the number of all-cause and cause-specific excess deaths among veterans serving after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks (9/11) with and without exposure to TBI.This cohort study analyzed administrative and mortality data from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2018, for a cohort of US military veterans who served during the Global War on Terrorism after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Veterans who served active duty after 9/11 with 3 or more years of care in the Military Health System or had 3 or more years of care in the Military Health System and 2 or more years of care in the Veterans Health Administration were included for analysis. The study used data from the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Identity Repository database, matching health records data from the Military Health Service Management Analysis and Reporting tool, the Veterans Health Administration Veterans Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, and the National Death Index. For comparison with the total US population, the study used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database. Data analysis was performed from June 16 to September 8, 2021.Traumatic brain injury.Multivariable, negative binomial regression models were used to estimate adjusted all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for the post-9/11 military veteran cohort, stratified by TBI severity level, and the total US population. Differences in mortality rates between post-9/11 military veterans and the total US population were used to estimate excess deaths from each cause of death.Among 2 516 189 post-9/11 military veterans (2 167 736 [86.2%] male; and 45 324 [1.8%] American Indian/Alaska Native, 160 178 [6.4%], Asian/Pacific Islander, 259 737 [10.3%] Hispanic, 387 926 [15.4%] non-Hispanic Black, 1 619 834 [64.4%] non-Hispanic White, and 43 190 [1.7%] unknown), 17.5% had mild TBI and 3.0% had moderate to severe TBI; there were 30 564 deaths. Adjusted, age-specific mortality rates were higher for post-9/11 military veterans than for the total US population and increased with TBI severity. There were an estimated 3858 (95% CI, 1225-6490) excess deaths among all post-9/11 military veterans. Of these, an estimated 275 (95% CI, −1435 to 1985) were not exposed to TBI, 2285 (95% CI, 1637 to 2933) had mild TBI, and 1298 (95% CI, 1023 to 1572) had moderate to severe TBI. Estimated excess deaths were predominantly from suicides (4218; 95% CI, 3621 to 4816) and accidents (2631; 95% CI, 1929 to 3333). Veterans with moderate to severe TBI accounted for 33.6% of total excess deaths, 11-fold higher than would otherwise be expected.This military veteran cohort experienced more excess mortality compared with the total US population than all combat deaths from 9/11/01 through 9/11/21, concentrated among individuals exposed to TBI. These results suggest that a focus on what puts veterans at risk for accelerated aging and increased mortality is warranted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Howard","given":"Jeffrey T."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Ian J."},{"family":"Amuan","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Janak","given":"Jud C."},{"family":"Pugh","given":"Mary Jo"}],"citation-key":"howardetal2022","container-title":"JAMA Network Open","container-title-short":"JAMA Network Open","DOI":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.48150","ISSN":"2574-3805","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,11]]},"page":"e2148150","source":"Silverchair","title":"Association of traumatic brain injury with mortality among military veterans serving after September 11, 2001","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.48150","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"hydeetal2019","abstract":"The view that humans comprise only two types of beings, women and men, a framework that is sometimes referred to as the “gender binary,” played a profound role in shaping the history of psychological science. In recent years, serious challenges to the gender binary have arisen from both academic research and social activism. This review describes 5 sets of empirical findings, spanning multiple disciplines, that fundamentally undermine the gender binary. These sources of evidence include neuroscience findings that refute sexual dimorphism of the human brain; behavioral neuroendocrinology findings that challenge the notion of genetically fixed, nonoverlapping, sexually dimorphic hormonal systems; psychological findings that highlight the similarities between men and women; psychological research on transgender and nonbinary individuals’ identities and experiences; and developmental research suggesting that the tendency to view gender/sex as a meaningful, binary category is culturally determined and malleable. Costs associated with reliance on the gender binary and recommendations for future research, as well as clinical practice, are outlined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hyde","given":"Janet Shibley"},{"family":"Bigler","given":"Rebecca S."},{"family":"Joel","given":"Daphna"},{"family":"Tate","given":"Charlotte Chucky"},{"family":"Anders","given":"Sari M.","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"hydeetal2019","container-title":"American Psychologist","container-title-short":"American Psychologist","DOI":"10.1037/amp0000307","ISSN":"1935-990X, 0003-066X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"language":"en","page":"171-193","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The future of sex and gender in psychology: Five challenges to the gender binary.","title-short":"The future of sex and gender in psychology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/amp0000307","volume":"74"},

  {"id":"indranimukherjeeetal2018","abstract":"The period 1800 to 800 Ma (“Boring Billion”) is believed to mark a delay in the evolution of complex life, primarily due to low levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. Earlier studies highlight the remarkably flat C, Cr isotopes and low trace element trends during the so-called stasis, caused by prolonged nutrient, climatic, atmospheric and tectonic stability. In contrast, we suggest a first-order variability of bio-essential trace element availability in the oceans by combining systematic sampling of the Proterozoic rock record with sensitive geochemical analyses of marine pyrite by LA-ICP-MS technique. We also recall that several critical biological evolutionary events, such as the appearance of eukaryotes, origin of multicellularity & sexual reproduction, and the first major diversification of eukaryotes (crown group) occurred during this period. Therefore, it appears possible that the period of low nutrient trace elements (1800–1400 Ma) caused evolutionary pressures which became an essential trigger for promoting biological innovations in the eukaryotic domain. Later periods of stress-free conditions, with relatively high nutrient trace element concentration, facilitated diversification. We propose that the “Boring Billion” was a period of sequential stepwise evolution and diversification of complex eukaryotes, triggering evolutionary pathways that made possible the later rise of micro-metazoans and their macroscopic counterparts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,29]]},"author":[{"literal":"Indrani Mukherjee"},{"family":"Large","given":"Ross R."},{"family":"Corkrey","given":"Ross"},{"family":"Danyushevsky","given":"Leonid V."}],"citation-key":"indranimukherjeeetal2018","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-22695-x","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,13]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"4432","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www-nature-com.antioch.idm.oclc.org","title":"The Boring Billion, a slingshot for Complex Life on Earth","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22695-x","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"infurnaetal2016","abstract":"Background: Research documents a strong relationship between childhood maltreatment and depression. However, only few studies have examined the speciﬁc effects of various types of childhood abuse/ neglect on depression. This meta-analysis estimated the associations between depression and different types of childhood maltreatment (antipathy, neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and psychological abuse) assessed with the same measure, the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA) interview.\nMethod: A systematic search in scientiﬁc databases included use of CECA interview and strict clinical assessment for major depression as criteria. Our meta-analysis utilized Cohen's d and relied on a random-effects model.\nResults: The literature search yielded 12 primary studies (reduced from 44), with a total of 4372 participants and 34 coefﬁcients. Separate meta-analyses for each type of maltreatment revealed that psychological abuse and neglect were most strongly associated with the outcome of depression. Sexual abuse, although signiﬁcant, was less strongly related. Furthermore, the effects of speciﬁc types of childhood maltreatment differed across adult and adolescent samples. Limitations: Our strict criteria for selecting the primary studies resulted in a small numbers of available studies. It restricted the analyses for various potential moderators.\nConclusion: This meta-analysis addressed the differential effects of type of childhood maltreatment on major depression, partially explaining between-study variance. The ﬁndings clearly highlight the potential impact of the more “silent” types of childhood maltreatment (other than physical and sexual abuse) on the development of depression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Infurna","given":"Maria Rita"},{"family":"Reichl","given":"Corinna"},{"family":"Parzer","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Schimmenti","given":"Adriano"},{"family":"Bifulco","given":"Antonia"},{"family":"Kaess","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"infurnaetal2016","container-title":"Journal of Affective Disorders","container-title-short":"Journal of Affective Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2015.09.006","ISSN":"01650327","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1]]},"language":"en","page":"47-55","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Associations between depression and specific childhood experiences of abuse and neglect: A meta-analysis","title-short":"Associations between depression and specific childhood experiences of abuse and neglect","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165032715305309","volume":"190"},

  {"id":"ispsus2021","abstract":"Stephanie Mitchell explores how IFS understands and works with people experiencing voices, visions, paranoia, and other non-ordinary states.\n\nIFS posits that there is no such thing as a ‘Unitary mind’, indeed the mind is made up of multiple ‘parts’ who interact internally in the same way that we interact in external relationships. These parts can become wounded by life’s adversities, and take on extreme roles in order to protect the person from further wounding. Each of these inner parts holds its own unique feelings, thoughts, experiences and core beliefs.\n\nA core tenet of IFS is that every part has a positive intent no matter how extreme their actions to protect the person.\n\nIFS believes that under all these parts is a person's ‘core Self’ and this Self cannot be damaged by life’s adversities and contains qualities of compassion and wisdom. Self is the natural leader of the system once parts are unburdened and trust Self’s leadership.\n\nThe IFS method promotes internal harmony by befriending parts and bringing healing to the parts who have been wounded.\n\nThe following topics are explored in this webinar:\n• Understanding ‘Parts’ and ‘Self’ in our own inner system when we are working as supporters/practitioners\n• Working with the ‘Parts’ and ‘Self’ of the client\n• Understanding why the ‘psychotic’ experience/parts are necessary and welcome and have a protective function, as viewed through the IFS lens\n• Using the IFS framework for working with parts who use voices, visions, and non-ordinary experiences in this protective way\n• Considering the spiritual implications of non-ordinary states\n\nAbout the presenter:\nStephanie Mitchell is a Level 3 trained IFS practitioner, psychotherapist, trainer and supervisor in private practice in Adelaide Australia. She specializes in working with complex trauma and experiences which often get labelled as 'mental illness'. She is interested in how healing and change occur in the human-to-human relationship, within spaces of safety and acceptance and outside the constructs of diagnostic labels. Stephanie has almost a decade working in Mental Health settings including 3 years co-facilitating a Hearing Voices group.\n\nThis webinar was organized by ISPS-US, an organization that promotes psychological and social approaches to psychosis and extreme states.

  {"id":"jardineetal2022","abstract":"Systematic investigation of reactivation-induced memory updating began in the 1960s, and a wave of research in this area followed the seminal articulation of “reconsolidation” theory in the early 2000s. Myriad studies indicate that memory reactivation can cause previously consolidated memories to become labile and sensitive to weakening, strengthening, or other forms of modification. However, from its nascent period to the present, the field has been beset by inconsistencies in researchers’ abilities to replicate seemingly established effects. Here we review these many studies, synthesizing the human and nonhuman animal literature, and suggest that these failures-to-replicate reflect a highly complex and delicately balanced memory modification system, the substrates of which must be finely tuned to enable adaptive memory updating while limiting maladaptive, inaccurate modifications. A systematic approach to the entire body of evidence, integrating positive and null findings, will yield a comprehensive understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of long-term memory storage and the potential for harnessing modification processes to treat mental disorders driven by pervasive maladaptive memories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Jardine","given":"Kristen H."},{"family":"Huff","given":"A.

  {"id":"jaxonetal2019","abstract":"The common stereotype that brilliance is a male trait is an obstacle to women's success in many prestigious careers. This gender-brilliance stereotype is powerful in part because it seems to be acquired early in life and might thus shape girls’ career aspirations. To date, however, research on this stereotype has not considered how its acquisition might intersect with (1) the other social identities that men and women are perceived to hold, and (2) the social identities that children themselves hold. The present study examined these open questions. First, we compared 5- and 6-year-old children's (N = 203) assumptions about the intellectual abilities of White men and women with their assumptions about the intellectual abilities of Black men and women. Second, we compared White children's assumptions about the intellectual abilities of men and women with those of children of color (primarily Latinx, Black, and Asian). The results suggested two main conclusions: First, children learn to associate White men (vs. women), but not Black men (vs. women), with brilliance. In fact, children generally see Black men as less brilliant than Black women. Second, the results suggested that the stereotype associating White men with brilliance is shared by children regardless of their own race. These results add considerable nuance to the literature on the development of gender stereotypes about intellectual ability and have implications for policies that might be implemented to prevent the negative effects of these stereotypes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Jaxon","given":"Jilana"},{"family":"Lei","given":"Ryan F."},{"family":"Shachnai","given":"Reut"},{"family":"Chestnut","given":"Eleanor K."},{"family":"Cimpian","given":"Andrei"}],"citation-key":"jaxonetal2019","container-title":"Journal of Social Issues","DOI":"10.1111/josi.12352","ISSN":"1540-4560","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"1192-1215","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Acquisition of Gender Stereotypes about Intellectual Ability: Intersections with Race","title-short":"The Acquisition of Gender Stereotypes about Intellectual Ability","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josi.12352","volume":"75"},

Fear conditioning was performed on Day 1. On Day 2, 38 participants were randomized into groups performing pursuit eye movements either immediately after fear memory reactivation, when the fear memory was stable, or 10 min later, when the fear memory was assumed to be more labile. On Day 3, fear memory strength was assessed by SCR to both reactivated and nonreactivated fear memories.\nResults: Strong differential conditioning to the spider stimuli were observed during both fear acquisition and fear memory reactivation. Reactivated fear memory conditioned responses of participants performing pursuit eye movements after a 10-min delay were significantly smaller in the reinstatement phase (0.16 μS; 95% CI [0.02, 0.31]).\nConclusions: Pursuit eye movements were effective in reducing fear-conditioned SCR in reinstatement.

A 2 × 4 mixed design was used to investigate the differences in accuracy and response time when identifying the valence of the emotional faces. Compared to the control group, the CEN group identified the valence of all emotional faces more slowly, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of accuracy.

  {"id":"johnsonetal2017","abstract":"Background: A recent open-label pilot study (N = 15) found that two to three moderate to high doses (20 and 30 mg/70 kg) of the serotonin 2A receptor agonist, psilocybin, in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation, resulted in substantially higher 6-month smoking abstinence rates than are typically observed with other medications or CBT alone. Objectives: To assess long-term effects of a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation program at ≥12 months after psilocybin administration. Methods: The present report describes biologically verified smoking abstinence outcomes of the previous pilot study at ≥12 months, and related data on subjective effects of psilocybin. Results: All 15 participants completed a 12-month follow-up, and 12 (80%) returned for a long-term (≥16 months) follow-up, with a mean interval of 30 months (range = 16–57 months) between target-quit date (i.e., first psilocybin session) and long-term follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 10 participants (67%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At long-term follow-up, nine participants (60%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At 12-month follow-up 13 participants (86.7%) rated their psilocybin experiences among the five most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives. Conclusion: These results suggest that in the context of a structured treatment program, psilocybin holds considerable promise in promoting long-term smoking abstinence. The present study adds to recent and historical evidence suggesting high success rates when using classic psychedelics in the treatment of addiction. Further research investigating psilocybin-facilitated treatment of substance use disorders is warranted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Matthew W."},{"family":"Garcia-Romeu","given":"Albert"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Roland R."}],"citation-key":"johnsonetal2017","container-title":"The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse","container-title-short":"The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse","DOI":"10.3109/00952990.2016.1170135","ISSN":"0095-2990, 1097-9891","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"55-60","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Long-term follow-up of psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/00952990.2016.1170135","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"jonesetal2021","abstract":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the reproductive aspirations of transgender women and their perceptions of uterus transplant. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional survey study used a 27-item electronic questionnaire to investigate the reproductive aspirations of 182 transgender women older than 16 years, including their perceptions of and motivations for uterus transplant, between May 1 and November 1, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Perceptions of and motivations for uterus transplant, including perceived significance of the ability to gestate, menstruate, and have a physiologically functioning vagina.\nRESULTS A total of 182 transgender women completed the questionnaire; most women (109 [60%]) were aged 20 to 29 years. Most did not have children prior to transitioning (167 [92%]) and expressed a desire to have children in the future (171 [94%]). In addition, most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the ability to gestate and give birth to children (171 [94%]) and menstruate (161 [88%]) would enhance perceptions of their femininity. Similarly, high proportions strongly agreed or agreed that having a transplanted, functioning vagina would improve their sexual experience (163 [90%]), improve their quality of life (163 [90%]), and help them to feel like more of a woman (168 [92%]). Nearly all respondents (180 [99%]) believed that uterus transplant would lead to greater happiness in transgender women. More than three-quarters of the respondents (140 [77%]) strongly agreed or agreed that they would be more inclined to cryopreserve sperm if uterus transplant became a realistic option.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides insights into the reproductive aspirations of transgender women and reports on their multifaceted motivation to undergo uterus transplant. The survey responses suggest that transgender women would choose to have female physiologic experiences, such as menstruation and gestation, as well as potentially having a physiologically functioning transplanted vagina. If proven feasible and safe in this setting, uterus transplant may facilitate the achievement of reproductive aspirations, improve quality of life, and further alleviate dysphoric symptoms in transgender women.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Benjamin P."},{"family":"Rajamanoharan","given":"Abirami"},{"family":"Vali","given":"Saaliha"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Nicola J."},{"family":"Saso","given":"Srdjan"},{"family":"Thum","given":"Meen-Yau"},{"family":"Ghaem-Maghami","given":"Sadaf"},{"family":"Quiroga","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Diaz-Garcia","given":"Cesar"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Wilkinson","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Yazbek","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Smith","given":"J.

  {"id":"kambojetal2020","abstract":"Background\nPharmacological treatments targeting the neuroendocrine stress response may hold special promise in secondary prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, findings from clinical trials have been inconsistent and the efficacy of specific drugs, their temporal window of efficacy, effective doses and the characteristics of likely treatment responders remain unclear.\n\nMethod\nUsing an experimental human model of distressing involuntary memory formation, we compare the effects of two drugs that have theoretical or empirical support as secondary preventive agents in PTSD. Eighty-eight healthy women (average age: 23.5 years) received oral propranolol (80 mg), hydrocortisone (30 mg), or matched placebo immediately after viewing a ‘trauma film’. They then completed daily, time-stamped intrusion diaries for 1 week, at the end of which, voluntary memory was tested.\n\nResults\nWhile neither drug affected voluntary memory for the trauma narrative, propranolol treatment was associated with 42% fewer, and hydrocortisone with 55% fewer intrusions across the week, relative to placebo. Additionally, propranolol reduced general trauma-like symptoms, and post-drug cortisol levels were negatively correlated with intrusion frequency in the hydrocortisone group.\n\nConclusions\nOverall, this study shows substantial reductions in intrusive memories and preserved voluntary narrative-declarative memory following either propranolol or hydrocortisone in an experimental model of psychological trauma. As such, despite some inconsistencies in clinical trials, our findings support continued investigation of propranolol and hydrocortisone as secondary preventive agents for re-experiencing symptoms of PTSD. The findings also suggest that it is critical for future research to identify the conditions governing the preventive efficacy of these drugs in PTSD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kamboj","given":"Sunjeev K."},{"family":"Gong","given":"An Tong"},{"family":"Sim","given":"ZhiHui"},{"family":"Rashid","given":"Adrihani A."},{"family":"Baba","given":"Ami"},{"family":"Iskandar","given":"Georges"},{"family":"Das","given":"Ravi K."},{"family":"Curran","given":"H.

  {"id":"karandashevetal2020","abstract":"Various physical characteristics of a partner—visual, auditory, tactile and kinetic, olfactory, and gustatory—can affect human mate choice and romantic attraction. Evolutionary factors, as well as socioeconomic and cultural parameters play their role in these sensory preferences. A series of studies in societies varying in social, economic, and cultural parameters (10 samples in six countries with 2740 participants in total) explored cross-cultural similarities and differences of sensory preferences that people have in their romantic attraction. The results revealed that social development of countries and their cultural parameters allow prediction of preferences of certain sensory parameters in one’s romantic partner’s appearance. The most general distinctions of sensory preferences are in the societies with different degree of modernization, along with corresponding social and cultural parameters. The stable biologically and evolutionarily determined characteristics of physical appearance, such as smell, skin, body, etc., are important for one’s sensory preferences in romantic attraction in less modernized societies, which are characterized by greater power distance, lower individualism, indulgence, and emancipative values. On the other hand, the characteristics of romantic partner’s appearance, which are more flexible and easier to change, such as expressive behavior, dress, dance, etc., are more important in more modernized societies with lower Power Distance, high value of Individualism, Indulgence, and Emancipation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Karandashev","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Zarubko","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Artemeva","given":"Veronika"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Makesha"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Kai Andito Damali"},{"family":"Neto","given":"Félix"},{"family":"Feybesse","given":"Cyrille"},{"family":"Surmanidze","given":"Lali"},{"family":"Purvis","given":"Jeanette"}],"citation-key":"karandashevetal2020","container-title":"Sexuality & Culture","container-title-short":"Sexuality & Culture","DOI":"10.1007/s12119-019-09628-0","ISSN":"1936-4822","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"23-53","source":"Springer Link","title":"Cross-Cultural Comparison of Sensory Preferences in Romantic Attraction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-019-09628-0","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"kashdanetal2006","abstract":"Extending previous work, we conducted two studies concerning the toxic influences of experiential avoidance (EA) as a core mechanism in the development and maintenance of psychological distress, and disruption of pleasant, engaging, and spontaneous activity. Of particular interest was whether EA accounted for relationships between coping and emotion regulation strategies on anxiety-related pathology (Study 1) and psychological distress and hedonic functioning over the course of a 21-day monitoring period (Study 2). In Study 1, EA mediated the effects of maladaptive coping, emotional responses styles, and uncontrollability on anxiety-related distress (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, trait anxiety, suffocation fears, and body sensation fears). In Study 2, EA completely mediated the effects of two emotion regulation strategies (i.e., suppression and reappraisal) on daily negative and positive experiences and was associated with diminished daily positive affective experiences and healthy life appraisals, diminished frequency of positive events and more frequent negative life events, and greater negative affective experiences. The present data show that cognitive reappraisal, a primary process of traditional cognitive-behavior therapy, was much less predictive of the quality of psychological experiences and events in everyday life compared with EA. Further consideration of experiential avoidance as a generalized diathesis and toxic process will be useful in improving our understanding of the etiology, phenomenology, and treatment of anxiety conditions, general human suffering, and disruptions in hedonic capacity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kashdan","given":"Todd B."},{"family":"Barrios","given":"Velma"},{"family":"Forsyth","given":"John P."},{"family":"Steger","given":"Michael F."}],"citation-key":"kashdanetal2006","container-title":"Behaviour Research and Therapy","container-title-short":"Behaviour Research and Therapy","DOI":"10.1016/j.brat.2005.10.003","ISSN":"0005-7967","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1301-1320","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Experiential avoidance as a generalized psychological vulnerability: Comparisons with coping and emotion regulation strategies","title-short":"Experiential avoidance as a generalized psychological vulnerability","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796705002123","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"katiemitchell2002","abstract":"Out of nowhere, like a cool breeze in a marketplace crowded with advice, comes Byron Katie and “The Work.” In the midst of a normal   life, Katie became increasingly depressed, and over a ten-year period sank further   into rage, despair, and thoughts of suicide. Then one morning, she woke up in a state   of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended.   The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now in Loving What Is you   can discover the same freedom through The Work. The Work is simply four questions   that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you   in an entirely different light. As Katie says, “It’s not the problem that causes   our suffering; it’s our thinking about the problem.” Contrary to popular belief,   trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The   Work, the thought lets go of us. At that point, we can truly love what is, just as   it is. Loving What Is will show you step-by-step, through clear and vivid examples,   exactly how to use this revolutionary process for yourself. You’ll see people do   The Work with Katie on a broad range of human problems, from a wife ready to leave   her husband because he wants more sex, to a Manhattan worker paralyzed by fear of   terrorism, to a woman suffering over a death in her family. Many people have discovered   The Work’s power to solve problems; in addition, they say that through The Work they   experience a sense of lasting peace and find the clarity and energy to act, even   in situations that had previously seemed impossible. If you continue to do The Work,   you may discover, as many people have, that the questioning flows into every aspect   of your life, effortlessly undoing the stressful thoughts that keep you from experiencing   peace. Loving What Is offers everything you need to learn and live this remarkable   process, and to find happiness as what Katie calls “a lover of reality.”","author":[{"family":"Katie","given":"Byron"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"katiemitchell2002","edition":"Reprint edition","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,5,7]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"298","publisher":"Harmony","source":"Amazon","title":"Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life","title-short":"Loving What Is","type":"book"},

The goal of the present review was to provide a comprehensive survey of meta-analyses examining the processes of CBT, namely: treatment processes (cognitive reappraisal, behavioral strategies, emotional regulation, motivation strategies, and psychoeducation) and in-session processes (alliance, goal consensus and collaboration, feedback, group cohesion, and homework). We identified 558 meta-analyses of CBT, and 30 meta-analyses met our inclusion criteria as reviews of process-outcome relations. For treatment processes, the strongest support currently exists for cognitive (n = 8 meta-analyses) and behavioral strategies (n = 3 meta-analyses) as change processes in CBT for anxiety disorders and depression. For in-session processes, the strongest support currently exists for the role of the alliance (n = 8 meta-analyses) and homework assignments (n = 6 meta-analyses) as predictors of outcome. Overall, the evidence base for process-outcome relations in CBT is just emerging. Additional research is needed to examine the range of treatment processes in various clinical contexts.

  {"id":"kerckhofetal2019","abstract":"Introduction\nStudies about sexual functioning in trans persons have mainly focused on sexual functioning after genital gender-affirming surgery, have had small sample sizes, and have not explored the broad range of possible sexual dysfunctions. Measuring sexual functioning in trans persons during transitioning is important to determine the kind of care trans persons may need in order to regain their sexual health.\nAim\nThe first aim of the present study was to explore the prevalence of sexual function disturbances and dysfunctions (with distress) in trans women and trans men 4 to 6 years after initial clinical entry. The second aim was to compare the prevalence of sexual dysfunctions among the various treatment trajectories and between trans persons with or without further genital treatment intentions.\nMethods\nAn online follow-up questionnaire was filled out by 518 trans persons (307 identifying predominantly feminine, 211 identifying predominantly masculine) as a part of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence initiative. All participants had their initial clinical appointments in gender clinics in Ghent, Amsterdam, or Hamburg.\nMain Outcome Measure\nThe main outcome measures were the prevalence of sexual dysfunctions and medical treatment data, measured via self-report items.\nResults\nThe most frequent sexual dysfunctions experienced by trans women and trans men were difficulties initiating and seeking sexual contact (26% and 32%, respectively) and difficulties achieving an orgasm (29% and 15%, respectively). Compared with trans women after hormone treatment and non-genital surgery, trans women after vaginoplasty less often experienced arousal difficulties, sexual aversion, and low sexual desire. Compared with trans men without medical treatment, trans men after a phalloplasty experienced sexual aversion and low sexual desire less often. No significant differences were found between participants with or without further genital treatment intentions.\nClinical implications\nClinicians should consider sexual counseling after medical treatments, paying particular attention to potential social and psychological barriers to the sexual health of their patients.\nStrengths & Limitations\nThis study included all trans persons irrespective of treatment decisions, and focused on a broad range of potential sexual difficulties taking the distress criteria into account. Limitations include the cross-sectional design, the limited power for the comparison of treatment groups and the absence of validated questionnaires about sexual functioning for transgender persons.\nConclusion\nSexual dysfunctions among trans men and women were very common among the various treatment groups and were unrelated to intentions to have further genital treatment. Although medical treatment may be helpful or even essential to developing good sexual health, a significant group of trans persons experienced sexual dysfunctions after genital surgery.

  {"id":"kerrbowen1988","abstract":"The concepts of Murray Bowen, one of the founders of family therapy and the originator of family systems theory, are brought together here in an integrative fashion. Michael Kerr (who worked with Bowen for many years) and Bowen propose that the enormously complex task of evaluating a clinical family can be orderly when it is grounded in family systems theory.  Using family diagrams and case studies, the book is devoted to an elegant explication of Bowen theory, which analyzes multigenerational family relationships and conceptualizes the family as an emotional unit or as a network of interlocking relationships, not only among the family members, but also among biological, psychological, and sociological processes. Bowen’s persistent inquiry and devotion to family observation, in spite of obstacles and frustrations, have resulted in a theory that has radically changed our ways of looking at all behavior.","author":[{"family":"Kerr","given":"Michael E."},{"family":"Bowen","given":"Murray"}],"citation-key":"kerrbowen1988","ISBN":"978-0-393-70056-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1988,10,17]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"420","publisher":"W.

  {"id":"khalsaetal2018","abstract":"Interoception refers to the process by which the nervous system senses, interprets, and integrates signals originating from within the body, providing a moment-by-moment mapping of the body’s internal landscape across conscious and unconscious levels. Interoceptive signaling has been considered a component process of reflexes, urges, feelings, drives, adaptive responses, and cognitive and emotional experiences, highlighting its contributions to the maintenance of homeostatic functioning, body regulation, and survival. Dysfunction of interoception is increasingly recognized as an important component of different mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, eating disorders, addictive disorders, and somatic symptom disorders. However, a number of conceptual and methodological challenges have made it difficult for interoceptive constructs to be broadly applied in mental health research and treatment settings. In November 2016, the Laureate Institute for Brain Research organized the first Interoception Summit, a gathering of interoception experts from around the world, with the goal of accelerating progress in understanding the role of interoception in mental health. The discussions at the meeting were organized around four themes: interoceptive assessment, interoceptive integration, interoceptive psychopathology, and the generation of a roadmap that could serve as a guide for future endeavors. This review article presents an overview of the emerging consensus generated by the meeting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Khalsa","given":"Sahib S."},{"family":"Adolphs","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Cameron","given":"Oliver G."},{"family":"Critchley","given":"Hugo D."},{"family":"Davenport","given":"Paul W."},{"family":"Feinstein","given":"Justin S."},{"family":"Feusner","given":"Jamie D."},{"family":"Garfinkel","given":"Sarah N."},{"family":"Lane","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Mehling","given":"Wolf E."},{"family":"Meuret","given":"Alicia E."},{"family":"Nemeroff","given":"Charles B."},{"family":"Oppenheimer","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Petzschner","given":"Frederike H."},{"family":"Pollatos","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Rhudy","given":"Jamie L."},{"family":"Schramm","given":"Lawrence P."},{"family":"Simmons","given":"W.

  {"id":"kindt2018","abstract":"Current pharmacological and psychological treatments for disorders of emotional memory only dampen the affective response while leaving the original fear memory intact. Under adverse circumstances, these original memories regain prominence, causing relapses in many patients. The (re)discovery in neuroscience that after reactivation consolidated fear memories may return to a transient labile state, requiring a process of restabilization in order to persist, offers a window of opportunity for modifying fear memories with amnestic agents. This process, known as memory reconsolidation, opens avenues for developing a revolutionary treatment for emotional memory disorders. The reconsolidation intervention challenges the dominant pharmacological and psychological models of treatment: it is only effective when the amnestic drug is given in conjunction with memory reactivation during a specific time window, and a modification of cognitive processes is a boundary condition for changing fear. Notwithstanding the dramatic effects of targeting memory reconsolidation in the laboratory (i.e. proof of principle), the greatest hurdle to overcome is that the success of the manipulation depends on subtle differences in the reactivation procedure. These experimental parameters cannot be easily controlled in clinical practice. In harnessing the clinical potential of memory reconsolidation, a heuristic for bi-directionally translating behavioural neuroscience and clinical science is proposed.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Of mice and mental health: facilitating dialogue between basic and clinical neuroscientists’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kindt","given":"Merel"}],"citation-key":"kindt2018","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2017.0033","issue":"1742","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,19]]},"page":"20170033","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"The surprising subtleties of changing fear memory: a challenge for translational science","title-short":"The surprising subtleties of changing fear memory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2017.0033","volume":"373"},

Complex relational trauma disrupts attachments, negatively impacting developing neurobiology and has significant implications for attachment behaviors, mental health, and treatment planning. We have developed a dynamic relational (DR) model of psychotherapy that aims to restore a healthy sense of belonging, targeting levels of activation and integration of large scale neural networks in the service of increasing the emotional capacities (attunement, processing, regulation, and expression) required to work through attachment trauma and establish healthy relationships. Our DR model provides an organizing framework through which to understand both the phenomenology observed in complex trauma and the mechanisms of therapeutic change. Our approach informs the weighting and timing of interventions to actively address capacity deficits, ego-syntonic symptoms, and unconscious resistance. The implications of this model also relate to the pathogenesis of mental disorder, and suggest prevention and early intervention efforts focus on modulation of subcortical (autonomic) responses and the encouragement of balanced cortical integration to enhance cognitive flexibility/psychological resilience. Ultimately, interventions based on our systematic model may modulate the genetic diathesis and comorbidities of relational trauma and increase psychological resilience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kinley","given":"Jacqueline L."},{"family":"Reyno","given":"Sandra M."}],"citation-key":"kinleyreyno2019","container-title":"Psychodynamic Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1521/pdps.2019.47.1.39","ISSN":"2162-2590","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3]]},"page":"39-51","publisher":"Guilford Publications Inc.","source":"guilfordjournals.com (Atypon)","title":"The price of needing to belong: Neurobiology of working through attachment trauma","title-short":"The price of needing to belong","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/pdps.2019.47.1.39","volume":"47"},

This article examines the influence of anger and fear on ethical decisions and ethical sensemaking strategies. In addition, emotion regulation strategies are examined as potential moderators of these relationships. Findings indicated that anger inhibited ethical decision making and sensemaking.

  {"id":"klingmulleretal2017","abstract":"It would be profoundly important if reconsolidation research in animals and other memory domains generalized to human episodic memory. A 3-d-list-discrimination procedure, based on free recall of objects, with a contextual reminder cue (the testing room), has been thought to demonstrate reconsolidation of human episodic memory (as noted in a previous study). Our goal was to replicate the central result, a high intrusion rate during recall of the target list, and evaluate the reconsolidation account relative to an alternative account, based on state-dependent learning and interference. First, replication was not straightforward (Experiment 1). Second, using a very unique, highly salient context (Experiment 2), the method produced a qualitative replication, but it was small in magnitude. A critical assumption of the reconsolidation account, that the target list is reactivated and destabilized during re-exposure to the study context, was not supported (Experiment 3). Although troubling for the reconsolidation account, the findings can be easily accommodated by an alternative account that does not assume additional neurobiological processes underlying the destabilization of consolidated memories, instead explaining intrusion rates simply in terms of well-established cognitive effects, such as item-to-context binding and interference during retrieval.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Klingmüller","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Caplan","given":"Jeremy B."},{"family":"Sommer","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"klingmulleretal2017","container-title":"Learning & Memory","container-title-short":"Learn.

  {"id":"kloeretal2021","abstract":"Background Vaginoplasty is a gender-affirming procedure for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) patients who experience gender incongruence. This procedure reduces mental health concerns and enhances patients’ quality of life. A systematic review investigating the sexual health outcomes of vaginoplasty has not been performed. Objectives To investigate sexual health after gender-affirming vaginoplasty for TGD patients. Data Sources MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases were searched, unrestricted by dates or study design. Methods We included primary literature that incorporated TGD patients, reported sexual health outcomes after vaginoplasty intervention and were available in English. Outcomes included at least one of these sexual health parameters: sexual desire, arousal, sensation, activity, secretions, satisfaction, pleasure, orgasm, interferences, or aids. Results Our search yielded 140 studies with 12 different vaginoplasty surgical techniques and 6,953 patients. The majority of these studies were cross-section or retrospective cohort observational studies (66%). 17.4%–100% (median 79.7%) of patients (n = 2,384) were able to orgasm postoperatively regardless of revision or primary vaginoplasty techniques. Female Sexual Function Index was the most used standardized questionnaire (17 studies, ranging from 16.9 to 28.6). 64%–98% (median 81%) of patients were satisfied with their general sexual satisfaction. The most common interference of sexual activity was dyspareunia. Conclusions The heterogenous methods of measuring sexual outcomes reflect the difficulty in comparing single-center surgical outcomes, encouraging the need for a standardized and validated metric for reporting sexual health after vaginoplasty for TGD patients. The most common sexual health parameter reported is sexual activity while therapeutic aids and pleasure were the least reported parameters.

  {"id":"koenigetal2019","abstract":"Background: Moral injury (MI) involves distress over having transgressed or violated core moral boundaries, accompanied by feelings of guilt, shame, self-condemnation, loss of trust, loss of meaning, and spiritual struggles. MI is often found in Veterans and Active Duty Military personnel with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). MI is widespread among those with PTSD symptoms, adversely affects mental health, and may increase risk of suicide; however, MI is often ignored and neglected by mental health professionals who focus their attention on PTSD only.Methods: A review of the literature between 1980 and 2018 conducted in 2018 is presented here to identify scales used to assess MI. Databases used in this review were PsychInfo, PubMed (Medline), and Google Scholar. Search terms were “moral injury,” “measuring,” “screening,” “Veterans,” and “Active Duty Military.” Inclusion criteria were quantitative measurement of MI and health outcomes, Veteran or Active Duty Military status, and peer-review publication. Excluded were literature reviews, dissertations, book chapters, case reports, and qualitative studies.Results: Of the 730 studies identified, most did not meet eligibility criteria, leaving 118 full text articles that were reviewed, of which 42 did not meet eligibility criteria. Of the remaining 76 studies, 34 were duplicates leaving 42 studies, most published in 2013 or later. Of 22 studies that assessed MI, five used scales assessing multiple dimensions, and 17 assessed only one or two aspects (e.g., guilt, shame, or forgiveness). The remaining 20 studies used one of the scales reported in the first 22. Of the five scales assessing multiple dimensions of MI, two assess both morally injurious events and symptoms and the remaining three assess symptoms only. All studies were cross-sectional, except three that tested interventions.Conclusions: MI in the military setting is widespread and associated with PTSD symptom severity, anxiety, depression, and risk of suicide in current or former military personnel. Numerous measures exist to assess various dimensions of MI, including five multidimensional scales, although future research is needed to identify cutoff scores and clinically significant change scores. Three multidimensional measures assess MI symptoms alone (not events) and may be useful for determining if treatments directed at MI may both reduce symptoms and impact other mental health outcomes including PTSD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Koenig","given":"Harold G."},{"family":"Youssef","given":"Nagy A."},{"family":"Pearce","given":"Michelle"}],"citation-key":"koenigetal2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Assessment of Moral Injury in Veterans and Active Duty Military Personnel With PTSD: A Review","title-short":"Assessment of Moral Injury in Veterans and Active Duty Military Personnel With PTSD","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00443","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"koenighilber2015","abstract":"The plant indole alkaloid ibogaine has shown promising anti-addictive properties in animal studies. Ibogaine is also anti-addictive in humans as the drug alleviates drug craving and impedes relapse of drug use. Although not licensed as therapeutic drug and despite safety concerns, ibogaine is currently used as an anti-addiction medication in alternative medicine in dozens of clinics worldwide. In recent years, alarming reports of life-threatening complications and sudden death cases, temporally associated with the administration of ibogaine, have been accumulating.

Not until 2000, when Nader and collaborators studied the behavioral effect of a protein synthesis inhibitor on retrieved memories, could this previous statement be taken under consideration once again; suggesting that consolidated memories can become labile after reactivation (Nader et al., 2000). The process of strengthening after memory labilization was named memory reconsolidation. In recent years, many studies pointed towards a critical participation of the ERK/MAPKs pathway in different memory processes (e.g. consolidation, extinction, reconsolidation, among others).

Measurements were performed in defined areas at the phallus and at the unoperated forearm as a control area. Additionally, all patients were asked to complete a questionnaire about their subjective quality of life and ability to orgasm.\nOutcome\nThis study evaluated the following parameters: perception of pressure (Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments) and vibration (C64 Hz tuning fork), static two-point discrimination, sharp-blunt and hot-cold discrimination at the phallus and the forearm, sum score of calculated life satisfaction, and ability to orgasm.\nResults\nMost of the patients (n = 14) were able to perceive 2 or more sensory modalities tested at the newly constructed phallus. 2 patients did not develop any sensibility. Interestingly, the median values for vibration perception were similar for the phallus and the unoperated forearm. Pressure sensibility was present at the phallus, but less than at the forearm. Moreover, sharp-blunt sensibility was present in 11 patients. In contrast, clear cold-warm discrimination could not be achieved, although the majority of patients detected the cold stimulus. A two-point discrimination of up to 23 mm could not be detected in either body part. 15 patients experienced orgasms without difficulty after 23 months (n = 20 after 54 months).\nClinical Implications\nWe observed successful recovery of sensibility at the phalli for the majority of patients, including the preservation of orgasm.\nStrengths & Limitations\nOur institution is one of the few centers regularly performing phalloplasties in transgender patients, especially preferring the technique of Gottlieb and Levine. This study contributes to the few studies that perform sensory testing at the phallus and is unique in its kind in that it uses a multimodal approach. A limitation of this study is the limited number of cases and the limited validity of vibratory testing.\nConclusion\nConfirming a promising tactile sensibility after phalloplasty with a neurovascular radial forearm flap, the next step would be to identify whether this reinnervation effectively develops due to nerve coaptation or spontaneous sprouting.

Where possible, random effect meta-analyses were conducted to determine pooled prevalence estimates. 42 studies were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. 28 of these studies met the requirements for inclusion in subsequent meta-analyses. Among studies that measured past-year physical IPV perpetration, the pooled prevalence was higher among men compared to women (26% and 20% respectively). Among Veterans, there were consistently higher prevalences compared to Active Duty samples. Similarly, higher prevalences were found among studies in general military settings compared to clinical settings. Further research that considers the impact of the act(s) of IPV perpetration on the victims is needed.

Within individual development it indicates a primary motivational system that guides the initial transactions between mother and baby and furthermore mediates affective attunement and regulation. Psychosocial learning, in close interaction with genetics and epigenetics, also develops a decisive foundation for further brain development of the infant. Finally, the attachment pattern established forms an enduring, relational context for later affective, cognitive, and social development of the child. As an unconsciously active matrix for future personal relationships it has a particular impact on the comprehensive psychological functions of empathy and mentalization. Early adverse and traumatic experiences or major emotional neglect may lead to different levels of security versus insecurity or disorientation-disorganization of the attachment pattern that corresponds to characteristic features of neurobiological regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lahousen","given":"Theresa"},{"family":"Unterrainer","given":"Human Friedrich"},{"family":"Kapfhammer","given":"Hans-Peter"}],"citation-key":"lahousenetal2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Psychobiology of attachment and trauma—Some general remarks from a clinical perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00914","volume":"10"},

Despite a number of comparative and comprehensive reviews on the effects of ADHD treatments on ADHD core symptoms, evidence synthesizing the effects of ADHD interventions on cognitive difficulties is limited. In this meta-analysis, the neuropsychological effects of non-pharmacological interventions for ADHD were examined across studies published between 1980 and 2017. Data were extracted from studies that used objective cognitive measures (either computerized or pencil-and-paper), and multiple meta-analyses were conducted to compare the effectiveness across these interventions. Publication bias was assessed, as well as quality of the evidence, using Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized control trials studies. Our final meta-analysis included 18 studies with interventions that were categorized into four categories: neurofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive training, and physical exercises. Physical exercises demonstrated the highest average effect size (Morris d = 0.93). A further evaluation of cognitive functions yielded 49 effect sizes for the five categories, including attention, inhibition, flexibility, and working memory. Analyses demonstrated a homogenous, medium to large, effect size of improvement across interventions, with inhibition demonstrating the largest average effect size (Morris d = 0.685). This study highlights the positive effect of psychological interventions on ADHD cognitive symptomology and supports the inclusion of non-pharmacological interventions in conjunction with the commonly used pharmacological treatments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lambez","given":"Bar"},{"family":"Harwood-Gross","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Golumbic","given":"Elana Zion"},{"family":"Rassovsky","given":"Yuri"}],"citation-key":"lambezetal2020","container-title":"Journal of Psychiatric Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Psychiatric Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.10.007","ISSN":"0022-3956","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"40-55","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Non-pharmacological interventions for cognitive difficulties in ADHD: A systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"Non-pharmacological interventions for cognitive difficulties in ADHD","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395619306168","volume":"120"},

  {"id":"laneetal2015","abstract":"Since Freud, clinicians have understood that disturbing memories contribute to psychopathology and that new emotional experiences contribute to therapeutic change. Yet, controversy remains about what is truly essential to bring about psychotherapeutic change. Mounting evidence from empirical studies suggests that emotional arousal is a key ingredient in therapeutic change in many modalities. In addition, memory seems to play an important role but there is a lack of consensus on the role of understanding what happened in the past in bringing about therapeutic change. The core idea of this paper is that therapeutic change in a variety of modalities, including behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, emotion-focused therapy, and psychodynamic psychotherapy, results from the updating of prior emotional memories through a process of reconsolidation that incorporates new emotional experiences. We present an integrated memory model with three interactive components – autobiographical (event) memories, semantic structures, and emotional responses – supported by emerging evidence from cognitive neuroscience on implicit and explicit emotion, implicit and explicit memory, emotion-memory interactions, memory reconsolidation, and the relationship between autobiographical and semantic memory. We propose that the essential ingredients of therapeutic change include: (1) reactivating old memories; (2) engaging in new emotional experiences that are incorporated into these reactivated memories via the process of reconsolidation; and (3) reinforcing the integrated memory structure by practicing a new way of behaving and experiencing the world in a variety of contexts. The implications of this new, neurobiologically grounded synthesis for research, clinical practice, and teaching are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lane","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Nadel","given":"Lynn"},{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Leslie"}],"citation-key":"laneetal2015","container-title":"Behavioral and Brain Sciences","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X14000041","ISSN":"0140-525X, 1469-1825","issued":{"literal":"2015/ed"},"language":"en","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Memory reconsolidation, emotional arousal, and the process of change in psychotherapy: New insights from brain science","title-short":"Memory reconsolidation, emotional arousal, and the process of change in psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/memory-reconsolidation-emotional-arousal-and-the-process-of-change-in-psychotherapy-new-insights-from-brain-science/D7E4F9A5AA0A1720AAED287B29419D4B","volume":"38"},

The unit content was presented in three stages: (a) Bias was defined in a manner such that all students willingly admitted that they were biased against some category of persons, (b) the functions of bias were discussed, and (c) a series of vignettes were given to the class for analysis as to whether bias existed in the situation described and, if it existed, what function it served.

Method and Data In this pilot study, we employed a quasi-experimental audit design and examined a stratified national sample of pediatric and family practice offices. Our final data include information from 205 audits (410 completed phone calls). Qualitative data were blind-coded into binary variables. Our case-control comparisons using McNemar's tests focused on acceptance of patients, withholding information, shaping conversations, and misattributions. Findings Compared to the control group, “Black” auditors were less likely to be told an office was accepting new patients and were more likely to experience both withholding behaviors and misattributions about public insurance. The strength of associations varied according to whether the cue was based on name or accent. Additionally, the likelihood and ways office personnel communicated that they were not accepting patients varied by region. Conclusions Linguistic profiling over the telephone is an aspect of structural racism that should be further studied and perhaps integrated into efforts to promote equitable access to care.

Research on the benefits of therapeutic interventions intended to increase positive affect indicates they promote prosocial behaviors and creativity, broaden the scope of attention, reduce emotional symptoms and behavioral problems, and improve physical health. Within the field of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy, procedures to increase positive affect have generally focused on resource development and installation procedures intended to increase access to positive affect-related memories and images. A neglected clinical issue is the inability of survivors of early neglect to tolerate and integrate actual positive interpersonal experience into positive emotional states, interpersonal scripts, or self-concepts. These deficiencies, characteristic of those with dismissing insecure attachment, help produce and maintain profound psychological, medical, and social problems that limit the ability of patients with these histories from progressing in psychotherapy. This article explores research supporting the potential benefits of an EMDR-related procedure, the positive affect tolerance (PAT) and integration protocol, along with possible mechanisms by which the PAT protocol in general, and its bilateral stimulation procedures, might produce clinical benefits for survivors of early neglect. Case vignettes illustrate the potential challenges of implementing and the potential impact of the PAT protocol. Research designs and assessment tools are described that could clarify the potential benefits of the PAT protocol compared to other treatments designed to increase positive affect.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Leeds","given":"Andrew M."}],"citation-key":"leeds2023","container-title":"Journal of EMDR Practice and Research","DOI":"10.1891/EMDR-2023-0006","ISSN":"1933-3196, 1933-320X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,26]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Springer","section":"Clinical Instruction","source":"connect.springerpub.com","title":"Foundations of the Positive Affect Tolerance Protocol: The Central Role of Interpersonal Positive Affect in Attachment and Self-Regulation","title-short":"Foundations of the Positive Affect Tolerance Protocol","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/early/2023/06/26/EMDR-2023-0006"},
  {"id":"leeetal2017","abstract":"The reactivation of a stored memory in the brain can make the memory transiently labile. During the time it takes for the memory to restabilize (reconsolidate) the memory can either be reduced by an amnesic agent or enhanced by memory enhancers. The change in memory expression is related to changes in the brain correlates of long-term memory. Many have suggested that such retrieval-induced plasticity is ideally placed to enable memories to be updated with new information. This hypothesis has been tested experimentally, with a translational perspective, by attempts to update maladaptive memories to reduce their problematic impact. We review here progress on reconsolidation updating studies, highlighting their translational exploitation and addressing recent challenges to the reconsolidation field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Jonathan L.

There, clinicians and clients negotiate tensions between this model's understanding of a multiple, refracted self and managed-care companies’ insistence on personal responsibility. In considering the moral and pragmatic work of IFS in the clinic, a new critical anthropology of selfhood illuminates the vectors through which economic and political commitments become imbricated in the self.

We suggest that this lack of emotion regulation can contribute to an unjust distribution of burdens that can further entrench moral damage in the context of relationships as well as help support large-scale patterns of white supremacy.

  {"id":"lim2016","abstract":"Whether emotion is universal or social is a recurrent issue in the history of emotion study among psychologists. Some researchers view emotion as a universal construct, and that a large part of emotional experience is biologically based. However, emotion is not only biologically determined, but is also influenced by the environment. Therefore, cultural differences exist in some aspects of emotions, one such important aspect of emotion being emotional arousal level. All affective states are systematically represented as two bipolar dimensions, valence and arousal. Arousal level of actual and ideal emotions has consistently been found to have cross-cultural differences. In Western or individualist culture, high arousal emotions are valued and promoted more than low arousal emotions. Moreover, Westerners experience high arousal emotions more than low arousal emotions. By contrast, in Eastern or collectivist culture, low arousal emotions are valued more than high arousal emotions. Moreover, people in the East actually experience and prefer to experience low arousal emotions more than high arousal emotions. Mechanism of these cross-cultural differences and implications are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Lim","given":"Nangyeon"}],"citation-key":"lim2016","container-title":"Integrative Medicine Research","container-title-short":"Integr Med Res","DOI":"10.1016/j.imr.2016.03.004","ISSN":"2213-4220","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"page":"105-109","PMCID":"PMC5381435","PMID":"28462104","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Cultural differences in emotion: differences in emotional arousal level between the East and the West","title-short":"Cultural differences in emotion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381435/","volume":"5"},

Surprisingly, there exists no empirically validated treatment for AD, despite its high prevalence in clinical practice. Considering the promise of memory reactivation under propranolol (i.e., reconsolidation interference) for treating posttraumatic stress disorder, we sought to extend this finding to AD, given that in both disorders, symptoms stem from an identified stressor.\nMethod\nA single-blind interrupted time series design was used to examine the efficacy of memory reactivation under propranolol to alleviate symptoms of AD. After being placed on a 4-week waitlist, sixty-one participants received 5 weekly 25-min treatments during which they recalled the betrayal event, 1 h after having orally ingested the beta-blocker propranolol.\nResults\nSegmented regression analyses on the intent-to-treat sample revealed that AD symptoms significantly decreased during the treatment phase (pre/post Cohen's d = 1.44), compared to the waitlist phase (d = 0.01). Significant pre/post reductions in anxio-depressive symptomatology were also found. Improvement was maintained at the 4-month follow-up on all outcomes.\nConclusion\nMemory reactivation under propranolol shows promise in reducing symptoms of AD.

  {"id":"luceroetal2018","abstract":"As many as one-third of all combat veterans experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder following their service to the military (United States Department of Veterans Affairs <xref>2016</xref>). Despite government efforts to provide care for those suffering from PTSD symptoms, veterans still struggle to receive appropriate and effective treatments. Inadequate care often has devastating effects on the veteran and his or her family. Currently, veterans typically receive individual treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. While the United States Department of Veterans Affairs provides individually focused evidenced based treatments, they do not currently endorse any particular model of family systems therapy for the treatment of PTSD in veterans or their families. The present article aims to demonstrate that Internal Family Systems (IFS), a systemic form of therapy, provides an effective treatment for combat veterans who suffer from PTSD. We propose that IFS’s collaborative approach, less-pathologizing stance, and simple language will resonate with military populations. We also argue that IFS provides a seamless transition between individual and family therapy allowing the therapist to address both the individual and relational effects of PTSD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Lucero","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Adam C."},{"family":"Hunsaker","given":"Jacob C."}],"citation-key":"luceroetal2018","container-title":"Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal","container-title-short":"Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal","DOI":"10.1007/s10591-017-9424-z","ISSN":"08922764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"page":"266-275","publisher":"Springer Nature","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Using Internal Family Systems Theory in the Treatment of Combat Veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Their Families","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://antioch.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=slh&AN=131094298&site=ehost-live&scope=site","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"luietal2020","abstract":"Alcohol is considered an integral part of the college life; students who hold stronger college alcohol beliefs typically consume more alcohol and experience more negative drinking consequences. Asian Americans are increasingly at risk for hazardous alcohol use, yet little research has focused on whether college alcohol beliefs are conceptualized similarly in this group and whether individuals’ cultural orientations moderate the relations between college alcohol beliefs and alcohol involvement. Asian American (N = 439; Mage = 22.77, 42.6% women) and Euro American (N = 161; Mage = 21.04; 41.6% women) undergraduate students were recruited to test measurement invariance of the College Life Alcohol Salience Scale and the Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale. We examined the relations between college alcohol beliefs and alcohol involvement, and the degree to which cultural orientations and ethnicity moderated these relations. Scores from a 14-item College Life Alcohol Salience Scale and a 26-item Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale demonstrated scalar invariance across Asian and Euro American groups. Bivariate correlations showed robust associations between college alcohol beliefs and alcohol involvement. Among Asian and Euro Americans who were not immersed in their ethnic heritage society, students were at greater odds of being a drinker when they endorsed stronger college alcohol beliefs, and drinkers consumed more alcohol when they endorsed lower college alcohol beliefs. Interventions aimed to prevent alcohol use and misuse can assess and target students’ college alcohol beliefs and promote greater connectedness to their ethnic heritage cultures.

Evidence indicates that some stressors, such as Early-Life Stress (ELS), mediate the co-occurrence of depression and chronic pain. This study aimed to assess whether ELS or any of its subtypes could be considered as risk factors for comorbidity between depression and chronic pain. For this purpose, n=44 patients in depressive episode were evaluated, which n=22 were diagnosed with depression and chronic pain, and the other n=22 patients were with depression, but depressive without chronic pain. Results had shown that ELS occurrence is more significant among depressive patients with chronic pain compared to those without pain. When subtypes of ELS was evaluated, the group of depressive patients with pain showed significantly higher prevalence of emotional neglect than those depressive participants without pain. Data analysis have shown that severity of the depressive symptoms has a significant impact on the total score of childhood trauma, emotional abuse, physical abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect. Also, that emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and physical neglect have significant impact on the severity of depression. In conclusion, our findings indicate that ELS can be considered as a risk factor for the comorbidity between depression and chronic pain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Macedo","given":"Brisa Burgos Dias"},{"family":"Von Werne Baes","given":"Cristiane"},{"family":"Menezes","given":"Itiana Castro"},{"family":"Juruena","given":"Mario F."}],"citation-key":"macedoetal2019","container-title":"Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease","container-title-short":"J Nerv Ment Dis","DOI":"10.1097/NMD.0000000000001031","ISSN":"1539-736X, 0022-3018","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7]]},"language":"en","page":"538-545","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Child abuse and neglect as risk factors for comorbidity between depression and chronic pain in adulthood","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/00005053-201907000-00002","volume":"207"},

  {"id":"magwoodetal2020","abstract":"Background Substance use is disproportionately high among people who are homeless or vulnerably housed. We performed a systematic overview of reviews examining the effects of selected harm reduction and pharmacological interventions on the health and social well-being of people who use substances, with a focus on homeless populations. Methods and findings We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Joanna Briggs Institute EBP, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and DARE for systematic reviews from inception to August 2019. We conducted a grey literature search and hand searched reference lists. We selected reviews that synthesized evidence on supervised consumption facilities, managed alcohol programs and pharmacological interventions for opioid use disorders. We abstracted data specific to homeless or vulnerably housed populations. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our search identified 483 citations and 30 systematic reviews met all inclusion criteria, capturing the results from 442 primary studies. This included three reviews on supervised consumption facilities, 24 on pharmacological interventions, and three on managed alcohol programs. Supervised consumption facilities decreased lethal overdoses and other high risk behaviours without any significant harm, and improved access to care. Pharmaceutical interventions reduced mortality, morbidity, and substance use, but the impact on retention in treatment, mental illness and access to care was variable. Managed alcohol programs reduced or stabilized alcohol consumption. Few studies on managed alcohol programs reported deaths. Conclusions Substance use is a common chronic condition impacting homeless populations. Supervised consumption facilities reduce overdose and improve access to care, while pharmacological interventions may play a role in reducing harms and addressing other morbidity. High quality evidence on managed alcohol programs is limited.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Magwood","given":"Olivia"},{"family":"Salvalaggio","given":"Ginetta"},{"family":"Beder","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Kendall","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Kpade","given":"Victoire"},{"family":"Daghmach","given":"Wahab"},{"family":"Habonimana","given":"Gilbert"},{"family":"Marshall","given":"Zack"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Ellen"},{"family":"O’Shea","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Lennox","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Tugwell","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Pottie","given":"Kevin"}],"citation-key":"magwoodetal2020","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0227298","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,16]]},"language":"en","page":"e0227298","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The effectiveness of substance use interventions for homeless and vulnerably housed persons: A systematic review of systematic reviews on supervised consumption facilities, managed alcohol programs, and pharmacological agents for opioid use disorder","title-short":"The effectiveness of substance use interventions for homeless and vulnerably housed persons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227298","volume":"15"},

However, it is now evident that these supposed disturbances cannot explain the development of this disorder, and so other possible mechanisms have been invoked, such as those involving the immune system that is attracting an increasing interest. According to the current literature, immune system alterations are reported in OCD of both children and adults. In children, it has been widely described as a clinical syndrome resulting from infections driven by group A &beta;-hemolytic streptococci and characterized by rheumatic fever, OCD, and neurological symptoms called &quot;pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus&quot;. In adults, available findings are meager and controversial, although intriguing. Such preliminary findings underline the presence of OCD in a number of autoimmune disorders, as well as of alterations of different immune parameters in OCD patients. This paper aims at presenting an exhaustive review of the role of the immune system in the development of OCD, with a major focus on the possible pathophysiological role of cytokines that seems to open novel treatment options.

  {"id":"martinhalverson1981","abstract":"The thesis of the present paper is that sex stereotyping is a normal cognitive process and is best examined in terms of information-processing constructs. A model is proposed in which stereotypes are assumed to function as schemas that serve to organize and structure information. The particular schemas involved in stereotyping are described, and the functions and biases associated with these schemas are elaborated. Both the development and maintenance of stereotypes are explained using the schematic processing model. The schematic model is found to be useful for explaining many of the results from sex-typing and stereotyping studies, as well as indicating areas needing further investigation. To describe the relation between sex schemas and other types of schemas, a typology is proposed which divides schemas according to whether they are potentially self-defining and according to their salience or availability. Using the typology, stereotyping and sex stereotyping are said to occur because the schemas involved are self-defining and salient. The role of salience in mediating the use of schemas is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"Carol Lynn"},{"family":"Halverson","given":"Charles F."}],"citation-key":"martinhalverson1981","container-title":"Child Development","DOI":"10.2307/1129498","ISSN":"0009-3920","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1981]]},"page":"1119-1134","publisher":"[Wiley, Society for Research in Child Development]","source":"JSTOR","title":"A Schematic Processing Model of Sex Typing and Stereotyping in Children","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1129498","volume":"52"},

When all wants are unsatisfied, the primary search for gratification will dominate all others in consciousness.

In Scattered Minds, he describes the painful realities of ADD and its effect on children as well as on career and social paths in adults.While acknowledging that genetics may indeed play a part in predisposing a person toward ADD, Dr. Maté moves beyond that to focus on the things we can control: changes in environment, family dynamics, and parenting choices. He draws heavily on his own experience with the disorder, as both an ADD sufferer and the parent of diagnosed children.

Therapy is shown here as a layered and nuanced process, with practitioners developing an ethical human rights perspective toward their work as they aid clients in negotiating for greater justice and equity in their relationships.

A framework for understanding gender issues within the larger patriarchy. Guidelines for relating concepts of race and class in therapy. Structure for creating the family cartography. Ways to utilize a queer perspective in therapy. Illustrative case examples throughout.

  {"id":"mcgruder2009","abstract":"Does current sex research in which people of African descent in the United States are the subjects present black sexuality as non-normative? If so, what is the impact of these presentations? The methodology used in this study included a qualitative review of research on sex and sexuality in which black people in the U.S. were research subjects. The study concludes that contemporary research on sexuality is dominated by research related to sexually transmitted infections, particularly AIDS and HIV. In the efforts to address this health crisis that has affected people of African descent in the U.S. disproportionately, some articles, perhaps inadvertently, present black sexuality in the U.S. as non-normative. This pathologizing of black sexuality occurs because some researchers studying aspects of sexuality in which the focus is on subjects of African descent in the United States, fail to either consider or describe possible systemic influences (poverty, racial discrimination, etc.) that affect the sexual behaviors of black people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"McGruder","given":"Kevin"}],"citation-key":"mcgruder2009","container-title":"Journal of African American Studies","container-title-short":"J Afr Am St","DOI":"10.1007/s12111-008-9070-5","ISSN":"1559-1646, 1936-4741","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9]]},"language":"en","page":"251-262","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Black sexuality in the U.S.: Presentations as non-normative","title-short":"Black sexuality in the U.S.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12111-008-9070-5","volume":"13"},

Although these conditions commonly affect children, threat conditioning and extinction have been primarily studied in adults. However, differences in phenomenology and neural architecture prohibit the generalization of adult findings to youth.\n\nAreas covered\nA comprehensive literature search using PubMed and PsycInfo was conducted to identify studies that have used differential conditioning tasks to examine threat acquisition and extinction in youth. The information obtained from this review helps to clarify the influence of these processes on the etiology and treatment of youth with OCD, PTSD and other anxiety disorders. Thirty studies of threat conditioning and extinction were identified.\n\nExpert Commentary\nYouth with anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD have largely comparable threat acquisition relative to unaffected controls, with some distinctions noted for youth with PTSD or youth who have suffered maltreatment. However, impaired extinction was consistently observed across youth with these disorders and appears to be consistent with deficiencies in inhibitory learning. Incorporating strategies to improve inhibitory learning may improve extinction learning within extinction-based treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Strategies to improve inhibitory learning in CBT are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"McGuire","given":"Joseph F."},{"family":"Orr","given":"Scott P."},{"family":"Essoe","given":"Joey K.-Y."},{"family":"McCracken","given":"James T."},{"family":"Storch","given":"Eric A."},{"family":"Piacentini","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"mcguireetal2016","container-title":"Expert review of neurotherapeutics","container-title-short":"Expert Rev Neurother","DOI":"10.1080/14737175.2016.1199276","ISSN":"1473-7175","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10]]},"page":"1155-1174","PMCID":"PMC5967402","PMID":"27275519","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Extinction learning in childhood anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder: implications for treatment","title-short":"Extinction learning in childhood anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5967402/","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"mcnicholsetal2020","abstract":"Background: Trans male gender affirming surgery is becoming more available resulting in an increase in patients undergoing these procedures. There are few reports evaluating the outcomes of these procedures in the transgender population. This study was performed to provide patient-centric insight on self-image and other concerns that arise during surgical transition.Methods: A 22-question survey was sent to 680 trans male patients. The survey was broken down into the following sections: demographics, timing and type of surgical procedures, self-image, sex/dating life, social life, employment, co-existing psychiatric morbidity, and common issues faced during the surgical transition.Results: A total of 246 patients responded (36% response rate). Most patients (54%) waited 1–2 years after starting their transition before having a surgical procedure, and 10% waited longer than 6 years. In regard to self-image, sex/dating life, and social life there was a significant improvement (p < 0.001) after undergoing gender affirming surgery. Patients reported significantly less difficulty with employment after having gender affirming surgery (p < 0.001). If present, the following psychiatric morbidities were self-reported to have a statistically significant improvement after surgery: depression, anxiety, substance abuse, suicidal ideation, panic disorder, social phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (P < 0.003).Conclusion: It is important to provide patients, surgeons, and insurance companies with expected outcomes of gender affirming surgery along with the potential risks and benefits. Post-surgical trans male patients reported a significant improvement in overall quality of life. Initial hesitations to having surgery such as regret and potential complications were found to be non-issues. Additional research should be done to include more patients with phalloplasties, trans females, and nonbinary identifying patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"McNichols","given":"Colton H.

  {"id":"mcruer2011","abstract":"This article attempts to “think disability” using the theoretical framework laid out by Gayle Rubin in her 1984 essay “Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality.” After considering how Rubin's essay was already arguably engaged with a disability politics (or, more broadly, a politics of embodiment), it reads “Thinking Sex” alongside another 1984 text, Deborah A. Stone's book The Disabled State, arguing that Stone's text, like Rubin's, is concerned with how capitalism sorts bodies and behaviors into dominant and subordinated categories. The Disabled State, however, can also be read as anticipating, from a disability studies perspective, queer analyses (such as Licia Fiol-Matta's book A Queer Mother for the Nation or Jasbir K. Puar's Terrorist Assemblages) that do not emerge until much later—analyses stressing the uneven biopolitical incorporation of seemingly marginalized subjects into the contemporary state. The article concludes with reflections on sex surrogacy and the Netherlands, using that location as an exemplary site for examining the complex and contradictory position of disability and sex in relation to the contemporary state.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"McRuer","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"mcruer2011","container-title":"GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies","DOI":"10.1215/10642684-2010-021","ISSN":"1064-2684, 1527-9375","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"107-117","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Disabling sex","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://read.dukeupress.edu/glq/article/17/1/107/34747/DISABLING-SEXNotes-for-a-Crip-Theory-of-Sexuality","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"meirdrexlerwolf2018","abstract":"During the postretrieval reconsolidation “window”, memories can be disrupted, strengthened, or updated using various pharmacological and behavioral manipulations. Behavioral manipulations are more ecologically valid, thus allowing better understating of memory modification under natural conditions, but they can also be less potent compared to pharmacological interventions. In this review we present the current human and animal literature, aiming to understand the modulatory factors (i.e., task relevance, complexity, intensity) that promote reconsolidation disruption in purely behavioral means. The reviewed studies have suggested that both very simple tasks and more complex learning paradigms can be used to disrupt or update memory reconsolidation, even of stronger emotional memories. Stress exposure is a possible interference task, yet the conflicting results leave many open questions regarding its required timing and intensity. Going from bench to bedside and back again, we point to the need for more research in clinical populations to establish the therapeutic potential of reconsolidation-based treatments. Several findings from outside the laboratory offer promising leads for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Meir Drexler","given":"Shira"},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Oliver T."}],"citation-key":"meirdrexlerwolf2018","container-title":"Behavioral Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Behavioral Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1037/bne0000231","ISSN":"1939-0084, 0735-7044","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2]]},"language":"en","page":"13-22","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Behavioral disruption of memory reconsolidation: From bench to bedside and back again.","title-short":"Behavioral disruption of memory reconsolidation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/bne0000231","volume":"132"},

  {"id":"mendesetal2022","abstract":"Substance use disorder (SUD) is a global public health concern that affects millions of people worldwide. Considering current research, addiction has been noted as the last stage of a chronic disease that may impair brain reward circuit responses and affects personal and social life. Treatments for SUD face challenges including availability and limited pharmacological response, often resulting in low retention of patients. A growing number of studies from the ‘psychedelic renaissance’ have highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for several psychiatric disorders, including SUD. In this non-systematic review we discuss past and current clinical and observational studies with classic (LSD, DMT, psilocybin and mescaline) and non-classic (ibogaine, ketamine, MDMA, salvinorin A and THC) psychedelics for the treatment of SUD published until December 2021. Although results are still inconclusive for LSD, DMT, mescaline, MDMA and Salvinorin A, in general, the literature presents moderate evidence on the controlled use of psilocybin and ketamine for Alcohol Use Disorder, ketamine for management of opiate and alcohol withdrawal, and THC preparations for reducing withdrawal symptoms in Cannabis and possibly in Opioid Use Disorder. Importantly, studies suggest that psychedelics should be more effective when employed as an adjunct therapy. Extensive research is warranted to further elucidate the role of psychedelics in the treatment of SUD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Mendes","given":"Fúlvio Rieli"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Cristiane dos Santos"},{"family":"Wiltenburg","given":"Victor Distefano"},{"family":"Morales-Lima","given":"Gabriela"},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"João Ariel Bonar"},{"family":"Filev","given":"Renato"}],"citation-key":"mendesetal2022","container-title":"Addiction Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Addiction Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1016/j.addicn.2022.100025","ISSN":"2772-3925","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100025","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Classic and non‐classic psychedelics for substance use disorder: A review of their historic, past and current research","title-short":"Classic and non‐classic psychedelics for substance use disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772392522000207","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"merloetal2014","abstract":"Memory persistence is critically influenced by retrieval. In rats, a single presentation of a conditioned fear stimulus induces memory reconsolidation and fear memory persistence, while repeated fear cue presentations result in loss of fear through extinction. These two opposite behavioral outcomes are operationally linked by the number of cue presentations at memory retrieval. However, the behavioral properties and mechanistic determinants of the transition have not yet been explored; in particular, whether reconsolidation and extinction processes coexist or are mutually exclusive, depending on the exposure to non-reinforced retrieval events. We characterized both behaviorally and molecularly the transition from reconsolidation to extinction of conditioned fear and showed that an increase in calcineurin (CaN) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) supports the shift from fear maintenance to fear inhibition. Gradually increasing the extent of retrieval induces a gradual decrease in freezing responses to the conditioned stimulus and a gradual increase in amygdala CaN level. This newly synthesized CaN is required for the extinction, but not the reconsolidation, of conditioned fear. During the transition from reconsolidation to extinction, we have revealed an insensitive state of the fear memory where NMDA-type glutamate receptor agonist and antagonist drugs are unable either to modulate CaN levels in the BLA or alter the reconsolidation or extinction processes. Together, our data indicate both that reconsolidation and extinction are mutually exclusive processes and also reveal the presence of a transitional, or “limbo,” state of the original memory between these two alternative outcomes of fear memory retrieval, when neither process is engaged.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Merlo","given":"Emiliano"},{"family":"Milton","given":"Amy L."},{"family":"Goozée","given":"Zara Y."},{"family":"Theobald","given":"David E."},{"family":"Everitt","given":"Barry J."}],"citation-key":"merloetal2014","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"mitchellwells2018","abstract":"Here are two widely held positions on the ethics of dating: First, people are generally morally justified in excluding people they don’t find attractive from their dating pool. Second, people are not justified in maintaining a dating pool that is racially exclusive, even on grounds like attraction. In this paper, we demonstrate how these positions are consistent. To do so we differentiate our attitudes in dating and our dating behavior.

  {"id":"mooreetal2019","abstract":"This study examined the state of the literature on the effectiveness of medication assisted treatment (MAT; methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) delivered in prisons and jails on community substance use treatment engagement, opioid use, recidivism, and health risk behaviors following release from incarceration. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies published through December 2017 that examined induction to or maintenance on methadone (n = 18 studies), buprenorphine (n = 3 studies), or naltrexone (n = 3 studies) in correctional settings were identified from PsycINFO and PubMed databases. There were a sufficient number of methadone RCTs to meta-analyze; there were too few buprenorphine or naltrexone studies. All quasi-experimental studies were systematically reviewed. Data from RCTs involving 807 inmates (treatment n = 407, control n = 400) showed that methadone provided during incarceration increased community treatment engagement (n = 3 studies; OR = 8.69, 95% CI = 2.46; 30.75), reduced illicit opioid use (n = 4 studies; OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.15; 0.32) and injection drug use (n = 3 studies; OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.12; 0.56), but did not reduce recidivism (n = 4 studies; OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.51; 1.68). Data from observational studies of methadone showed consistent findings. Individual review of buprenorphine and naltrexone studies showed these medications were either superior to methadone or to placebo, or were as effective as methadone in reducing illicit opioid use post-release. Results provide the first meta-analytic summary of MATs delivered in correctional settings and support the use of MATs, especially with regard to community substance use treatment engagement and opioid use; additional work is needed to understand the reduction of recidivism and other health risk behaviors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Kelly E."},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Reid","given":"Holly H."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Kathryn M.

  {"id":"morgadoetal2016","abstract":"Rock crystal appears relatively frequently in Late Prehistoric Iberian sites, especially in the form of micro-blades and knapping debris. With some exceptions, however, these finds have seldom been looked into in any detail, and therefore little is known about the technology involved in the use of this material, its social and economic relevance or its symbolic significance. In this paper we examine a collection of rock crystal artefacts recently found at Valencina de la Concepción (Seville, Spain), one of the largest 3rd millennium BC sites in Western Europe. Among the objects included in this study are a long dagger blade, twenty-five arrowheads and a core, all of which form the most technically sophisticated and esthetically impressive collection of rock crystal material culture ever found in Prehistoric Iberia. Through the analysis of the procedures and techniques applied in the production of these objects, the chemical characterisation of the raw materials through Raman spectroscopy and RTI image processing and the careful assessment of the archaeological contexts in which they were found, this paper makes a robust contribution towards the study of the role of rock crystal in Copper Age technology and society. Recent research suggest that Valencina was a major node in the circulation of exotic materials such as ivory, amber, cinnabar or flint in Copper Age Iberia, which provides a very good background to assess the relevance of rock crystal as a traded commodity. In addition we discuss the role of rock crystal as a marker of status in large megalithic monuments, as well as its possible symbolic connotations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Morgado","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Lozano","given":"José Antonio"},{"family":"García Sanjuán","given":"Leonardo"},{"family":"Triviño","given":"Miriam Luciañez"},{"family":"Odriozola","given":"Carlos P."},{"family":"Irisarri","given":"Daniel Lamarca"},{"family":"Flores","given":"Álvaro Fernández"}],"citation-key":"morgadoetal2016","collection-title":"New approaches to the study of Quartz lithic industries","container-title":"Quaternary International","container-title-short":"Quaternary International","DOI":"10.1016/j.quaint.2015.08.004","editor":[{"family":"Cox","given":"Bob"},{"family":"Blow","given":""}],"ISSN":"1040-6182","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,7]]},"language":"en","page":"232-249","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The allure of rock crystal in Copper Age southern Iberia: Technical skill and distinguished objects from Valencina de la Concepción (Seville, Spain)","title-short":"The allure of rock crystal in Copper Age southern Iberia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618215007582","volume":"424"},
  {"id":"morganetal2022","abstract":"Nearly one in four Medicare beneficiaries have been diagnosed with mental health or substance use disorders, and research indicates this population responds well to mental health treatment. However, Medicare policy omits licensed mental health counselors (LMHCs) and licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFTs) as approved providers, exacerbating an existing national provider shortage. Emerging research demonstrates that the provider omission, referred to as the Medicare mental health coverage gap (MMHCG), profoundly impacts excluded providers and the communities they serve. This paper represents a synthesis of the most current scholarship on Medicare research, policy, and advocacy. In particular, we explore three ways the MMHCG impacts providers and beneficiaries alike: limiting provider choices, thwarting continuity of care, and creating challenging decisions for beneficiaries and providers. Our aim is to help mental health counselors better understand and navigate the MMHCG and aid in advocacy efforts for legislation to include LMHCs and LMFTs as approved Medicare providers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Morgan","given":"Amy A."},{"family":"Fullen","given":"Matthew C."},{"family":"Wiley","given":"Jonathan D."}],"citation-key":"morganetal2022","container-title":"Journal of Mental Health Counseling","DOI":"10.1774/mehc.44.1.04","event-place":"Alexandria, United States","ISSN":"10402861","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1]]},"language":"English","license":"Copyright American Mental Health Counselors Association Jan 2022","number-of-pages":"32-48","page":"32-48","publisher":"American Mental Health Counselors Association","publisher-place":"Alexandria, United States","source":"ProQuest","title":"A case of the tail wagging the dog: The Medicare mental health coverage gap and its impact on providers and beneficiaries","title-short":"A case of the tail wagging the dog","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2634592808/abstract/B7F5F9F966454877PQ/1","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"moss-racusinetal2012","abstract":"Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants’ preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Moss-Racusin","given":"Corinne A."},{"family":"Dovidio","given":"John F."},{"family":"Brescoll","given":"Victoria L."},{"family":"Graham","given":"Mark J."},{"family":"Handelsman","given":"Jo"}],"citation-key":"moss-racusinetal2012","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1211286109","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"41","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,10,9]]},"language":"en","license":"©  .

  {"id":"mulleretal2019","abstract":"Early life maltreatment (ELM) is the major single risk factor for impairments in social functioning and mental health in adulthood. One of the most prevalent and most rapidly increasing forms of ELM is emotional neglect. According to bio-behavioral synchrony assumptions, the oxytocin and attachment systems play an important mediating role in the interplay between emotional neglect and social dysfunctioning. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether fear and avoidance of social functioning, two important and highly prevalent facets of social dysfunctioning in adulthood, are shaped by emotional neglect, plasma oxytocin levels and attachment representations. We assessed emotional neglect as well as other forms of ELM with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, current attachment representations with the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System, and fear and avoidance of social situations with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale in a population-based sample of N = 121 men and women. Furthermore, 4.9 ml blood samples were drawn from each participant to assess peripheral plasma oxytocin levels. Applying a sequential mediation model, results revealed that emotional neglect was associated with lower plasma oxytocin levels which in turn were associated with insecure attachment representations which were related to elevated fear and avoidance of social situations (a1d21b2: F3,117 = 20.84, P < .001). Plasma oxytocin and current attachment representations hence fully and sequentially mediate the effects of emotional neglect on social fear and avoidance, two important facets of adult social dysfunctioning, confirming bio-behavioral synchrony assumptions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Müller","given":"Laura E."},{"family":"Bertsch","given":"Katja"},{"family":"Bülau","given":"Konstatin"},{"family":"Herpertz","given":"Sabine C."},{"family":"Buchheim","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"mulleretal2019","collection-title":"Oxytocin and Social Relationships","container-title":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","container-title-short":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2018.05.011","ISSN":"0167-8760","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"73-80","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Emotional neglect in childhood shapes social dysfunctioning in adults by influencing the oxytocin and the attachment system: Results from a population-based study","title-short":"Emotional neglect in childhood shapes social dysfunctioning in adults by influencing the oxytocin and the attachment system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167876017307134","volume":"136"},

  {"id":"mutschleretal2022","abstract":"Research and reviews to date suggest that community-based residential treatments for substance use disorders (SUDs) have mixed effectiveness, with some studies finding positive outcomes while others finding no differences between intervention arms, including inpatient, outpatient, and control groups. In order to understand these mixed findings, reviews have underscored the importance of outlining the active treatment components of residential treatment, as well as treatment mechanisms and outcomes. Further, there is very little research on the underlying theories explaining how and for whom residential treatments are effective. The purpose of the present realist synthesis was to address this gap in the literature by exploring how, why, for whom, and in what circumstances, community-based residential treatments are effective. Following the RAMESES Publication Standards, a search was undertaken for articles examining community-based residential treatments in PsycINFO and PubMed from anytime to January 2020. The search generated 28 articles that met inclusion criteria and were extracted for relevant information. Results of the realist synthesis identified six Context-Mechanism-Outcome (CMO) configurations. Contextual factors that generated subsequent mechanisms and outcomes included substance-related problem severity, psychiatric comorbidities, diverse populations, pre-treatment relationships, lack of structure and lack of coping strategies. These CMO configurations provide important information for clinicians, treatment centres and policy makers, including the specific programme components that need to be offered in treatment to facilitate positive treatment outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Mutschler","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Junaid","given":"Sana"},{"family":"Tellez","given":"Carmina"},{"family":"Franco","given":"Giselle"},{"family":"Gryspeerdt","given":"Charlie"},{"family":"Bushe","given":"Julianne"}],"citation-key":"mutschleretal2022","container-title":"Health & Social Care in the Community","DOI":"10.1111/hsc.13511","ISSN":"1365-2524","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"e287-e304","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Community-based residential treatment for alcohol and substance use problems: A realist review","title-short":"Community-based residential treatment for alcohol and substance use problems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hsc.13511","volume":"30"},

Three core ideas are discussed: modern schema theory, the frequency of automatic decision-making and implicit processes as the default mode of human information processing. The De ning Issues Test (DIT) measures the beginnings of moral understanding, which are largely non-verbal and intuitive, in contrast to the Moral Judgement Interview (MJI), which measures the highest level of verbal understanding. The positive attributes of the DIT and its conceptualisation of moral judgement schemas are more apparent in a time of increasing respect for implicit knowledge and processing. The DIT offers a means of measuring moral judgement that ts with current views in cognitive science.

  {"id":"nazetal2019","abstract":"Conversations around improving access to psychological therapies for BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) service users have been ongoing for many years without any conclusion or resolution. BAME service users are often under-represented in primary care mental health services, and often have worse outcomes, leading to them being portrayed as ‘hard to reach’, and to deterioration in their mental health. They are over-represented in secondary care mental health services. The authors of this article argue that more resources are required in order to understand the barriers to accessing mental health services, and improve both access and recovery for BAME service users. This paper examines concepts such as race, ethnicity and culture. It aims to support service managers and therapists to develop their confidence to address these issues in order to deliver culturally competent psychological therapies to service users from BAME communities, with a focus on primary care. It is based on our experiences of working with BAME communities and the feedback from our training events on developing cultural competence for CBT therapists. The paper also discusses the current political climate and the impact it may have on service users and the need for therapists to take the wider political context into consideration when working with BAME service users. Finally, the paper stresses the importance of addressing structural inequalities at a service level, and developing stronger ethical guidelines in the area of working with diversity for CBT therapists in the UK.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Naz","given":"Saiqa"},{"family":"Gregory","given":"Romilly"},{"family":"Bahu","given":"Meera"}],"citation-key":"nazetal2019","container-title":"The Cognitive Behaviour Therapist","container-title-short":"tCBT","DOI":"10.1017/S1754470X19000060","ISSN":"1754-470X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"e22","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Addressing issues of race, ethnicity and culture in CBT to support therapists and service managers to deliver culturally competent therapy and reduce inequalities in mental health provision for BAME service users","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1754470X19000060/type/journal_article","volume":"12"},

To address that gap, this article presents findings from a qualitative study on the therapeutic preferences of bisexual females in same-gender relationships. Eight female, same-gender couples, in which at least one partner identified as bisexual, were interviewed for the purposes of answering the research question: What should therapists know about working with female bisexual couples? Thematic analysis revealed three salient themes: 1) bisexual couples are like any other couple, 2) bisexual couples face internal stigma, 3) and therapists have bisexual stigma. Findings indicate a need for therapists to be educated regarding bisexuality and to address biases that could impact treatment.

  {"id":"nikitinetal2021","abstract":"Memory recovery in amnestic animals is one of the most poorly studied processes. In this paper, we examine the role of protein synthesis and a reminder in the mechanisms of amnesia and memory recovery in grape snails trained to conditioned food aversion. Amnesia was induced by the impairment of memory reconsolidation using NMDA (N-methyl d-aspartate) glutamate receptor antagonists. In an early stage of amnesia (day 3), injections of protein synthesis inhibitors into animals combined with a reminder by a conditioned stimulus (CS) led to the recovery of aversive reactions to its presentation. Two types of changes in reactions to CS were revealed. In most animals, a persistent recovery of memory retrieval was found that lasted for at least 10 days. In other snails, aversive responses to CS persisted for 24 h. Isolated injections of inhibitors, injections of inhibitors and a reminder by the learning environment (without presenting a CS), usage of a differentiating stimulus instead of a CS, or inhibitor injections after the reminder did not affect the development of amnesia. The administration of protein synthesis inhibitors and a reminder in the late period after amnesia induction (10 days) did not affect its development or caused a short-term memory recovery. We suggest that amnesia is an active process that develops over time. The reminder induces the reactivation of the amnesia process dependent on protein synthesis, while the administration of protein synthesis inhibitors leads to the impairment of amnesia reactivation and recovery of the state formed before amnesia induction (i.e., recovery of conditioned food aversion memory).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Nikitin","given":"V.

  {"id":"novacblinder2021","abstract":"Free association is still widely accepted as a fundamental component of psychoanalysis. However, despite notable advances in cognitive science, only a limited number of studies of free association by means of neurological methods exist. This review surveys a representative sample of neuroimaging studies on free association available to this date. Neuroimaging findings on free association, mind wandering, meditation, and other forms of spontaneous thought process seem to share significant commonalities. Free association is also examined in view of the literature on free energy, predictive coding, error prediction, and down-regulation of the default mode network. In this sense, the authors propose that free association and the role of the default mode network and the executive network are part of a complex process of adaptive reshaping of thought and autobiographical memory. The authors further propose that FA is an internally energized emotional cognitive mobility that taps into all forms of memory (episodic, implicit, embodied unformulated) and facilitates memory reconsolidation and simulation of future possibilities. In addition, creativity, as an evolutionary potential to form predictions and paradigm shifts, is presented in the context of adaptation and survival. Seen in this context, free association can lead to a creative therapeutic change in treatment that favors introspective, ontoethical, and social adaptation. Further investigation of free association by means of neuroscientific studies will need to include more specific parameters that closely mimic the experience of free association during psychoanalysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Novac","given":"Andrei"},{"family":"Blinder","given":"Barton J."}],"citation-key":"novacblinder2021","container-title":"Neuropsychoanalysis","DOI":"10.1080/15294145.2021.1976666","ISSN":"1529-4145","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,6]]},"page":"1-27","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Free association in psychoanalysis and its links to neuroscience contributions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15294145.2021.1976666","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"novinsetal2016","abstract":"Background\nResearch and health surveillance activities continue to document the substantial disparities in the impacts of substance abuse on the health of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. While Evidence-Based Treatments (EBTs) hold substantial promise for improving treatment for AI/ANs with substance use problems (as they do for non-AI/ANs), anecdotal reports suggest that their use is limited. In this study, we examine the awareness of, attitudes toward, and use of EBTs in substance abuse treatment programs serving AI/AN communities.\nMethods\nData are drawn from the first national survey of tribal substance abuse treatment programs. Clinicians or clinical administrators from 192 programs completed the survey. Participants were queried about their awareness of, attitudes toward, and use of 9 psychosocial and 3 medication EBTs.\nResults\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (82.2%), Motivational Interviewing (68.6%), and Relapse Prevention Therapy (66.8%) were the most commonly implemented psychosocial EBTs; medications for psychiatric comorbidity was the most commonly implemented medication treatment (43.2%). Greater EBT knowledge and use were associated with both program (e.g., funding) and staff (e.g., educational attainment) characteristics. Only two of the commonly implemented psychosocial EBTs (Motivational Interviewing and Relapse Prevention Therapy) were endorsed as culturally appropriate by a majority of programs that had implemented them (55.9% and 58.1%, respectively).\nConclusions\nEBT knowledge and use is higher in substance abuse treatment programs serving AI/AN communities than has been previously estimated. However, many users of these EBTs continue to have concerns about their cultural appropriateness, which likely limits their further dissemination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Novins","given":"Douglas K."},{"family":"Croy","given":"Calvin D."},{"family":"Moore","given":"Laurie A."},{"family":"Rieckmann","given":"Traci"}],"citation-key":"novinsetal2016","container-title":"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","container-title-short":"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.02.007","ISSN":"0376-8716","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"214-221","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Use of evidence-based treatments in substance abuse treatment programs serving American Indian and Alaska Native communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037687161600082X","volume":"161"},

The practice has become a contentious policy issue, with multiple jurisdictions limiting the use of credit reports in employment.

Recent qualitative research finds that employers evaluate credit reports in contingent and person-specific ways, which opens the door to bias according to applicant characteristics, such as race and sex. To test for potential disparate impact in employment outcomes from the use of credit reports, we conduct a survey experiment with 1,050 hiring professionals.

  {"id":"olcaysoyokten2018","abstract":"Previous research showed that people infer traits from others’ behaviors without any intention or awareness being necessary (Uleman et al., 2012). Nevertheless, this phenomenon has only been measured through limited behavioral information about others received at a single point in time. The persistence of or change in spontaneously formed trait inferences (STIs) over time and in the presence of new trait-inconsistent information has not been investigated previously. The present work aimed to examine this question by presenting a theoretical model of STI formation and updating and testing this model through five experiments.\nDrawing on past research on implicit evaluations and explicit trait attributions, we hypothesized that STIs should be robust and resistant to change over time and in the presence of new trait-inconsistent information. This would be due to perceivers forming and storing new STIs (including the ones that are semantically inconsistent with the initial STIs) independently from the initial STIs in memory. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that STIs were not affected by trait-inconsistent information subsequently learned about the same target actor (Experiment 1a and 1b), and were persistent over 48 hours after initial formation. STIs were also formed from the subsequently learned behavioral information (even trait-inconsistent information), yet, stored independently from the initial STIs as hypothesized. Participants held multiple implicit inferences about the same actor, even when the traits were inconsistent.\nNext, the present study investigated memory reconsolidation as a possible mechanism for updating spontaneous impressions. Existing work on memory reconsolidation established that memories become flexible when they are reactivated, even after they are consolidated over time. Similarly, we hypothesized that having initial associations about persons reactivated when learning about new information about those persons should facilitate memory restructuring, and thus impression updating. The updating of implicit impressions was expected to manifest itself in two ways; first, participants would decrease the strength of STIs they formed from the initial behaviors, and second, they would increase the strength of SGI (context-dependent, spontaneous goal inferences) formed from these initial behaviors. The results for STI updating were mixed. When participants learned about the initial behaviors via three cycles of exposure (and thus strongly encoded in participants’ memory), they did not update their STIs formed from these initial behaviors in light of new trait-inconsistent information presented after memory reactivation (Experiment 2). The expected pattern of updating (the disappearance of the STI effect in a false recognition task within this particular learning condition) was observed in Experiment 4, when participants learned about the positive behaviors of actors initially (by being exposed to each behavior once), and were asked to make quick judgments about the actors who performed those behaviors. Also, consistent with our predictions about updating of SGIs, in Experiment 3, participants’ pattern of SGIs (especially of those with a better memory of actors’ behaviors) were stronger after having learned about trait-inconsistent new information upon memory reactivation. In addition, those with stronger SGIs tended to form weaker STIs about the same actors in Experiment 3, suggesting that SGI might have been construed as an alternative to STI. All experiments that measured behavior memory showed a primacy effect; old (initial) behaviors were recalled better than new behaviors of the actors. Among the new behaviors, those that were consistent with the old behaviors in terms of implied trait were remembered better than those that implied inconsistent traits or did not imply any trait information. The implications of the findings on the stickiness of first impressions and primacy effect in behavior memory are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Olcaysoy Okten","given":"Irmak"}],"citation-key":"olcaysoyokten2018","event-place":"United States -- Pennsylvania","genre":"Ph.D.","ISBN":"9781085791489","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"English","license":"Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","number-of-pages":"227","publisher":"Lehigh University","publisher-place":"United States -- Pennsylvania","source":"ProQuest","title":"Updating Spontaneous Trait Inferences: An Analysis of Memory Reconsolidation as a Mechanism of Changing First Impressions","title-short":"Updating Spontaneous Trait Inferences","type":"thesis","URL":"http://www.proquest.com/docview/2296779630/abstract/10915FC240DE4E76PQ/1"},

  {"id":"oneilletal2021","abstract":"The long term poor health outcomes in those who have experienced multiple adverse events in childhood have been well documented since the late 1990’s. People who have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are at signiﬁcantly increased risk of chronic disease as well as mental illness and health risk behaviours. There is growing evidence of the ways in which adversity and toxic stress, cause these poor outcomes. Exposure to adversity has been shown to alter the molecular and genetic makeup of a child as well as changing the way the neurological, immune and endocrine systems develop and function. ACEs are of great public health concern given their long term impact on an individual’s health along with the impact on society through economic factors such as loss of productivity and increasing pressure on the healthcare system. Intergenerational and environmental factors have been implicated in perpetuating the cycle of ACEs. Thus, both primary and secondary preventive intervention programmes need to be considered in ﬁrstly preventing the occurrence of ACEs and secondly striving to mitigate their ill effects. This article describes the background scientiﬁc studies, prevalence and types of risk factors and their effects on human biology and goes on to outline how ACEs contribute to later adult health status and how we might mitigate these through improved primary and secondary prevention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Neill","given":"Ríoghnach S."},{"family":"Boullier","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Blair","given":"Mitch"}],"citation-key":"oneilletal2021","container-title":"Clinics in Integrated Care","container-title-short":"Clinics in Integrated Care","DOI":"10.1016/j.intcar.2021.100062","ISSN":"26668696","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8]]},"language":"en","page":"100062","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Adverse childhood experiences","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2666869621000282","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"owenetal2012","abstract":"In the present study, the authors examined the source of racial/ethnic minority (REM) disparities in unilateral termination (i.e., the client ending therapy without informing the therapist)—a form of dropout that is associated with poor alliance and outcome. First, the authors tested whether some therapists were more likely to have clients who reported unilaterally terminating as compared with other therapists. Next, the authors examined 2 competing hypotheses regarding the therapists role in termination disparities: (a) that racial/ethnic disparities in unilateral termination are similar across therapists and thus due to other components of the treatment process or (b) that racial/ethnic disparities in unilateral termination are specific to therapists, where some therapists are more likely, on average, to have higher rates of unilateral termination with REM clients as compared with White clients. The sample included 155 REM clients and 177 White clients who were treated by 44 therapists at a university counseling center. The results showed that therapists accounted for a significant proportion of the variation in clients’ unilateral termination, and REM clients were more likely to report they unilaterally terminated from therapy as compared with White clients. Furthermore, racial/ethnic disparities in clients’ report of unilateral termination varied across therapists’ caseloads. These results suggest that therapists have a central role in their clients’ unilateral termination and have implications for understanding racial/ethnic mental health disparities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Owen","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Imel","given":"Zac"},{"family":"Adelson","given":"Jill"},{"family":"Rodolfa","given":"Emil"}],"citation-key":"owenetal2012","container-title":"Journal of Counseling Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Counseling Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/a0027091","ISSN":"1939-2168, 0022-0167","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"314-320","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"'No-show': Therapist racial/ethnic disparities in client unilateral termination.","title-short":"'No-show'","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0027091","volume":"59"},
  {"id":"owenetal2015","abstract":"Objective The current study used multilevel growth mixture modeling to ascertain groups of patients who had similar trajectories in their psychological functioning over the course of short-term treatment. Method A total of 10,854 clients completed a measure of psychological functioning before each session. Psychological functioning was measured by the Behavioral Health Measure, which is an index of well-being, symptoms, and life-functioning. Clients who attended 5 to 25 sessions at 46 different university/college counseling centers and one community mental health center were included in this study. Client diagnoses and the specific treatment approaches were not known. Results A 3-class solution was a good fit to the data. Clients in classes 1 and 3 had moderate severity in their initial psychological functioning scores, and clients in class 2 had more distressed psychological functioning scores. The trajectory for clients in class 1 was typified by early initial change, followed by a plateau, and then another gain in psychological functioning later in treatment. The trajectory for clients in class 2 demonstrated an initial decrease in functioning, followed by a rapid increase, and then a plateau. Last, the clients in class 3 had a steady increase of psychological functioning, in a more linear manner. Conclusion The trajectories of change for clients are diverse, and they can ebb and flow more than traditional dose-effect and good-enough level models may suggest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Owen","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Adelson","given":"Jill"},{"family":"Budge","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Wampold","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Kopta","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Minami","given":"T."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"owenetal2015","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Psychology","DOI":"10.1002/jclp.22191","ISSN":"1097-4679","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"817-827","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Trajectories of change in psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.22191","volume":"71"},
  {"id":"ozeretal2022","abstract":"Introduction\nMuch has been published on the surgical and functional results following Gender Affirming Surgery (‘GAS’) in trans individuals. Comprehensive results regarding sexual wellbeing following GAS, however, are generally lacking.\nAim\nTo review the impact of various GAS on sexual wellbeing in treatment seeking trans individuals, and provide a comprehensive list of clinical recommendations regarding the various surgical options of GAS on behalf of the European Society for Sexual Medicine.\nMethods\nThe Medline, Cochrane Library and Embase databases were reviewed on the results of sexual wellbeing after GAS.\nMain Outcomes Measure\nThe task force established consensus statements regarding the somatic and general requirements before GAS and of GAS: orchiectomy-only, vaginoplasty, breast augmentation, vocal feminization surgery, facial feminization surgery, mastectomy, removal of the female sexual organs, metaidoioplasty, and phalloplasty. Outcomes pertaining to sexual wellbeing- sexual satisfaction, sexual relationship, sexual response, sexual activity, enacted sexual script, sexuality, sexual function, genital function, quality of sex life and sexual pleasure- are provided for each statement separately.\nResults\nThe present position paper provides clinicians with statements and recommendations for clinical practice, regarding GAS and their effects on sexual wellbeing in trans individuals. These data, are limited and may not be sufficient to make evidence-based recommendations for every surgical option. Findings regarding sexual wellbeing following GAS were mainly positive. There was no data on sexual wellbeing following orchiectomy-only, vocal feminization surgery, facial feminization surgery or the removal of the female sexual organs. The choice for GAS is dependent on patient preference, anatomy and health status, and the surgeon's skills. Trans individuals may benefit from studies focusing exclusively on the effects of GAS on sexual wellbeing.\nConclusion\nThe available evidence suggests positive results regarding sexual wellbeing following GAS. We advise more studies that underline the evidence regarding sexual wellbeing following GAS. This position statement may aid both clinicians and patients in decision-making process regarding the choice for GAS. Özer M, Toulabi SP, Fisher AD, et al.

The current study explored the frequency of parent–adolescent consent communication, as well as demographic, adolescent, and parent predictors of adolescents’ beliefs about the importance of consent and the frequency of parent–adolescent consent communication. Two national samples were used, one consisting of 2,044 adolescents, ages 13 to 18 (Mage = 16.19, SD = 1.71; 50% female), and a second sample of 2,081 nonrelated individuals, ages 28 to 81, who were parents of teens ages 13–18 (Mage = 15.25, SD = 1.56). Findings suggested that parents did not talk about sexual consent any more than they did about other sexual topics (e.g., reproduction). We also found that maternal warmth was positively associated with adolescents’ importance of consent beliefs and that adolescents’ uninhibited temperament and parents’ self-efficacy and sexual beliefs were associated with parent–adolescent consent communication. The discussion focuses on the need to educate parents so they feel more confident talking to adolescents about the importance of giving and receiving sexual consent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Padilla-Walker","given":"Laura M."},{"family":"McLean","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Ogles","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Pollard","given":"Brittany"}],"citation-key":"padilla-walkeretal2020","container-title":"The Journal of Sex Research","container-title-short":"The Journal of Sex Research","DOI":"10.1080/00224499.2020.1792397","ISSN":"0022-4499, 1559-8519","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,21]]},"language":"en","page":"1122-1133","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How do parents teach “no means no”?

  {"id":"panetal2021","abstract":"When memories are reactivated, they enter a period of instability in which they can be affected by a variety of follow-up manipulations. The existence of this type of memory reconsolidation offers the potential for clinical interventions of maladaptive memory. However, such potential cannot be fully exploited until the internal mechanisms of memory changes via reconsolidation are better understood. In the current study, we used a three-day AB-AC paradigm that included self-referential simulation processing and employed electroencephalogram (EEG) techniques to explore how post-retrieval updates of episodic memory come about. Behaviorally, we found that reactivation alongside interference learning (ReI-L, AB-AC, n = 52) can produce much more false memories compared to no reactivation new learning (New-L, AB-DC, n = 31) and reactivation repetitive learning (Rep-L, AB-AB. n = 30). More importantly, ERP results revealed that trials from ReI-L in which memory distortions subsequently occurred showed an observable (compared to the new-learning without memory reactivation) but attenuated (compared to trials associating with later intact memory) amplitude of frontal N400, indicating a moderate level of early conflict reactivation is necessary to trigger crucial memory instability. In addition, to promote optimal distortion of the original memory, a sufficient later constructional processing is also required, reflecting in these intrusive/later false trials showed a larger amplitude of late posterior negativity (LPN). A linear classifier employing neuro features of FN400 and LPN during the reconsolidation phase could predict the original memory retention with 72% accuracy. The present findings indicate that nuance in post-retrieval interference, moderate conflict with protracted construction can lead to optimal alterations of episodic memories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Pan","given":"Dong-ni"},{"family":"Hoid","given":"Delhii"},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Oliver T."},{"family":"Li","given":"Xuebing"}],"citation-key":"panetal2021","container-title":"Neurobiology of Learning and Memory","container-title-short":"Neurobiology of Learning and Memory","DOI":"10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107531","ISSN":"1074-7427","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,28]]},"language":"en","page":"107531","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Brain activities of reconsolidation: Nuances in post-retrieval interference led to optimal alterations of episodic memories","title-short":"Brain activities ofreconsolidation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742721001532"},

  {"id":"panzaetal2022","abstract":"Background\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is a prevalent public health concern in the U.S. that disproportionately affects veterans relative to civilians. Given changes to the demographic composition of the veteran population and AUD diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5, updated knowledge regarding the epidemiology of DSM-5 AUD in a national sample of veterans is critical to informing the population-based burden of this disorder.\nMethods\nData were analyzed from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative sample of 4069 U.S. veterans. Lifetime DSM-5 AUD (mild, moderate, severe) and past-year DSM-5 AUD were assessed using validated self-report measures, and sociodemographic, military, and psychiatric characteristics associated with lifetime and past-year AUD were evaluated.\nResults\nPrevalences of lifetime and past-year DSM-5 AUD were 40.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]=39.2–42.3%) and 10.5% (95%CI=9.6–11.5%), respectively. Lifetime prevalences of mild, moderate, and severe AUD were 20.5%, 8.3%, and 12.0%, respectively. Veterans with lifetime AUD had elevated rates of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior, which generally increased as a function of AUD severity. Lifetime AUD was also associated with being younger, male, white, unmarried, retired and experiencing more adverse childhood experiences and traumas. For past-year AUD, being younger, male, white, having more adverse childhood experiences, and experiencing lifetime PTSD were significant correlates.\nConclusions\nAUD is highly prevalent among U.S. veterans and associated with substantial psychopathology, including elevated odds of suicidal behaviors. Results underscore the importance of comprehensive screening and preventive efforts for AUD, and interventions that concurrently target overlapping alcohol use and psychiatric difficulties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Panza","given":"Kaitlyn E."},{"family":"Kline","given":"Alexander C."},{"family":"Na","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Potenza","given":"Marc N."},{"family":"Norman","given":"Sonya B."},{"family":"Pietrzak","given":"Robert H."}],"citation-key":"panzaetal2022","container-title":"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","container-title-short":"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109240","ISSN":"0376-8716","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109240","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Epidemiology of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder in U.S. military veterans: Results from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study","title-short":"Epidemiology of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder in U.S. military veterans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871621007353","volume":"231"},

Aims: We designed a survey to evaluate the influence of surgery after phalloplasty (osteofasciocutaneous fibula free flap or osteofasciocutaneous radial free forearm flap) on QOL, emotional stability, self-esteem, and psyche of postoperated transgender men. Methods: The present study included 32 transgender men who had undergone gender-affirming surgery (GAS) exclusively in our department between 2000 and 2012. Apart from our self-developed, indication-specific questionnaire with questions on socioeconomic and demographic data as well as postoperative satisfaction, the testing instrument included 4 frequently used, standardized testing instruments, which we compared with normative data. These included (a) a self-assessment test Fragebogen zur Lebenszufriedenheit with questions on QOL consisting of 3 modules (general satisfaction, satisfaction with health, and satisfaction with body image/outer appearance), (b) the Freiburg Personality Inventory, (c) the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Questionnaire, and (d ) the Patient Health Questionnaire 4. Findings: Our self-developed, indication-specific questionnaire showed that 88% of our patients were very satisfied with the aesthetic result, 75% have had sex after surgery, and 72% were very satisfied with sexual function after GAS. Eighty-one percent had a strong improvement of QOL, and 91% would undergo the same treatment again. Eighty-four percent would recommend GAS to others. All patients lived as men fulltime. Discussion: Our study reveals that GAS plays an important part in the interdisciplinary treatment of transgender individuals as it improves the QOL in transgender men in most aspects of everyday life and has a positive influence on the patients' psyche and self-esteem in a retrospective study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Papadopulos","given":"Nikolaos A."},{"family":"Ehrenberger","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Zavlin","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Lellé","given":"Jean-Daniel"},{"family":"Henrich","given":"Gerhard"},{"family":"Kovacs","given":"Laszlo"},{"family":"Herschbach","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Machens","given":"Hans-Günther"},{"family":"Schaff","given":"Jürgen"}],"citation-key":"papadopulosetal2021","container-title":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","DOI":"10.1097/SAP.0000000000002693","ISSN":"0148-7043","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,4]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Quality of Life and Satisfaction in Transgender Men After Phalloplasty in a Retrospective Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/SAP.0000000000002693","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print"},

  {"id":"pedreiraetal2004","abstract":"In previous experiments on contextual memory, we proposed that the unreinforced re-exposure to the learning context (conditioned stimulus, CS) acts as a switch guiding the memory course toward reconsolidation or extinction, depending on reminder duration. This proposal implies that the system computes the total exposure time to the context, from CS onset to CS offset, and therefore, that the reminder presentation must be terminated for the switching mechanism to become operative. Here we investigated to what extent this requirement is necessary, and we explored the relation between diverse phases in the reconsolidation and extinction processes. We used the contextual memory model of the crab Chasmagnathus which involves an association between the learning context (CS) and a visual danger stimulus (unconditioned stimulus, US). Administration of cycloheximide was used to test the lability state of memory at different time points. The results show that two factors, no-reinforcement during the reminder (i.e., CS re-exposure) and CS offset are the necessary conditions for both processes to occur. Regardless of the reminder duration, memory retrieved by unreinforced CS re-exposure emerges intact and consolidated when tested before CS offset, suggesting that neither reconsolidation nor extinction is concomitant with CS re-exposure. Either process could only be triggered once the definitive mismatch between CS and US is confirmed by CS termination without the expected reinforcement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Pedreira","given":"María Eugenia"},{"family":"Pérez-Cuesta","given":"Luis María"},{"family":"Maldonado","given":"Héctor"}],"citation-key":"pedreiraetal2004","container-title":"Learning & Memory","container-title-short":"Learn.

  {"id":"perrotteetal2018","abstract":"Background: Latina/o college students have been shown to engage in more high risk drinking behavior than students from other ethnic minority groups, and are more likely to experience certain negative alcohol related consequences as a result of drinking. Previous research links stress to drinking among college students and indicates drinking occurs within a gendered context. Although this suggests an effect of gender role socialization, studies exploring these relationships among Latina/os are lacking. Objectives: To explore potential relationships of stress, gender role prescriptions of the heritage culture, and drinking among Latina/o college students. Specifically, to explore potential interactions between stress and multiple dimensions of machismo and marianismo as related to alcohol use. Method: Latina/o undergraduates (N = 248) completed a questionnaire. Self-reported stress, quantity of alcohol consumption, and frequency of binge drinking were recorded for all participants. Gender role prescriptions were assessed via endorsement of two dimensions of machismo (men) or two dimensions of marianismo (women). Results: Stress was positively related to general quantity for women. Each dimension of machismo was distinctly related to binge drinking for men. Significant interactions emerged between both machismo and marianismo and stress as related to both alcohol use outcomes. For women, the moderating pattern between marianismo and stress varied according to type of alcohol use. Conclusions/Importance: Gender role beliefs influence the relationship between stress and alcohol use among Latina/o college students.

Qualitative interviews were conducted with 28 women of White, Black, and Latino racial/ethnic descent who reported a substance use disorder in the past 5 years.

A codebook was developed using the Theory of Planned Behavior to code and identify barriers within the domains of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control toward specialty treatment. Frequencies for coded themes were then compared across all participants and by race/ethnicity. We identified several key differences in barriers to treatment by race/ethnicity. Attitudinal barriers were more pervasive among the narratives of Latinas relative to Black and White women. Latinas were more likely to report not needing treatment and that treatment would not be effective; Latinas were the only group to describe cultural barriers to treatment. Within the subjective norms domain, namely stigma and lack of support, were key barriers. Stigma was more pervasive among the narratives of Latinas and Black women than White women; Latinas were more likely to report a lack of social support for using treatment than both Black and White women.

But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research.A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan's \"mental travelogue\" is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives.","author":[{"family":"Pollan","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"pollan2018","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-59420-422-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,15]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"464","publisher":"Penguin Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Amazon","title":"How to change your mind: what the new science of psychedelics teaches us about consciousness, dying, addiction, depression, and transcendence","title-short":"How to change your mind","type":"book"},

One likely explanation for those results is that memory reconsolidation was blocked by propranolol. Objective We explored the influence of various predictors on treatment outcome (i.e., PTSD severity), and whether the treated individuals improved in other important domains of functioning associated with PTSD. Method Thirty-three patients with longstanding PTSD participated in a 6-week open-label trial consisting of actively recalling one's trauma under the influence of propranolol, once a week. Results Treated patients reported a better quality of life, less comorbid depressive symptoms, less negative emotions in their daily life and during trauma recollections. Women were also found to improve more than men. Type of trauma (childhood vs. adulthood), time elapsed since trauma, borderline personality traits, depressive symptoms severity, Axis I comorbidity, and age did not influence treatment outcome.

  {"id":"preeceetal2022","abstract":"Background: Ever since alexithymia was defined in the 1970s, robust associations have been observed between alexithymia and a variety of symptoms of psychopathology. Alexithymia is now widely regarded as an important transdiagnostic risk factor, and it is frequently assessed in clinical and research settings. However, despite this strong interest, it remains unclear exactly why (i.e., by which mechanisms) alexithymia is linked to psychopa­ thology. In this paper, we hypothesise that alexithymia is linked to affective disorder symptoms because alex­ ithymia impairs people’s ability to regulate their emotions, and we empirically test this hypothesis.\nMethod: We administered a battery of psychometric measures to 501 adults in the United States, and examined the direct and indirect effects between alexithymia (Perth Alexithymia Questionnaire), emotion regulation ability (Perth Emotion Regulation Competency Inventory), and affective disorder symptoms (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21).\nResults: In the Pearson bivariate correlation matrix, alexithymia, emotion regulation difficulties, and affective disorder symptoms were all significantly correlated. In the modelling of direct and indirect effects, alexithymia was indirectly associated with affective disorder symptoms through emotion regulation difficulties (no signifi­ cant direct effect). Limitations: Our online survey data were all self-report data and cross-sectional. Future longitudinal work would be beneficial.\nConclusions: Our findings support contemporary theorising that alexithymia is linked to affective disorder symptoms via emotion regulation difficulties. These results help to clarify the mechanisms by which alexithymia may predispose people to affective disorder symptoms, and highlight the importance of considering the roles of alexithymia and emotion regulation in case conceptualisations and treatment planning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Preece","given":"David A."},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Ashish"},{"family":"Becerra","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Wai"},{"family":"Allan","given":"Alfred"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Boyes","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Hasking","given":"Penelope"},{"family":"Gross","given":"James J."}],"citation-key":"preeceetal2022","container-title":"Journal of Affective Disorders","container-title-short":"Journal of Affective Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.085","ISSN":"01650327","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1]]},"language":"en","page":"337-341","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Why is alexithymia a risk factor for affective disorder symptoms?

  {"id":"quillianetal2017","abstract":"This study investigates change over time in the level of hiring discrimination in US labor markets. We perform a meta-analysis of every available field experiment of hiring discrimination against African Americans or Latinos (n = 28). Together, these studies represent 55,842 applications submitted for 26,326 positions. We focus on trends since 1989 (n = 24 studies), when field experiments became more common and improved methodologically. Since 1989, whites receive on average 36% more callbacks than African Americans, and 24% more callbacks than Latinos. We observe no change in the level of hiring discrimination against African Americans over the past 25 years, although we find modest evidence of a decline in discrimination against Latinos. Accounting for applicant education, applicant gender, study method, occupational groups, and local labor market conditions does little to alter this result. Contrary to claims of declining discrimination in American society, our estimates suggest that levels of discrimination remain largely unchanged, at least at the point of hire.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Quillian","given":"Lincoln"},{"family":"Pager","given":"Devah"},{"family":"Hexel","given":"Ole"},{"family":"Midtbøen","given":"Arnfinn H."}],"citation-key":"quillianetal2017","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1706255114","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"41","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,10]]},"language":"en","license":"©  .

  {"id":"rodriguez-canoetal2023","abstract":"Introduction Ibogaine is one of the alkaloids naturally found in plants such as Tabernanthe iboga, which has been traditionally used by members of the Bwiti culture. Since the discovery of its anti-addictive properties by Howard S. Lotsof in 1962, ibogaine has been used experimentally to treat substance use disorders (SUD), especially those involving opioids. We aim to provide a detailed understanding of the underlying psychological aspects of underground ibogaine use for the treatment of SUD. Methods Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 13 participants with SUD, which motivated their self-treatment with ibogaine. The data were analysed using the grounded theory approach and considered the context of the treatment, and the nature of the occurring hallucinogenic and cognitive phenomena during the treatment experience. Results We identified several psychological effects that the study respondents experienced, which seem to play a substantial role in the therapeutic process concerning SUD. The evoking of interpersonal and transpersonal experiences, autobiographical memories, and preparation, integration and motivation for a lifestyle change are important components that participants reported during and after ibogaine intake. Discussion and Conclusion Ibogaine is increasingly being used for the treatment of SUD, due in part to the limited treatment options currently available. Its beneficial effects seem to be related not only to its complex pharmacology but also to the subjective experience that ibogaine induces. The main aspects of this experience are related to autobiographical memories and valuable personal insights, which together appear to help individuals cope with their SUD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodríguez-Cano","given":"Borja J."},{"family":"Kohek","given":"Maja"},{"family":"Ona","given":"Genís"},{"family":"Alcázar-Córcoles","given":"Miguel Ángel"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Rafael G.","non-dropping-particle":"dos"},{"family":"Hallak","given":"Jaime E.

  {"id":"rose2012","abstract":"This article examines how Miami's significant presence of Anglo Caribbean blacks and Spanish-speaking tourists critically influenced the evolution of race relations before and after the watershed 1959 Cuban Revolution. The convergence of people from the American South and North, the Caribbean, and Latin America created a border culture in a city where the influx of Bahamian blacks and Spanish-speakers, especially tourists, had begun to alter the racial landscape. To be sure, Miami had many parallels with other parts of the South in regard to how blackness was understood and enforced by whites during the first half of the twentieth century. However, I argue that the city's post-WWII meteoric tourist growth, along with its emergence as a burgeoning Pan-American metropolis, complicated the traditional southern black-white dichotomy. The purchasing power of Spanish-speaking visitors during the postwar era transformed a tourist economy that had traditionally catered to primarily wealthy white transplanted Northerners. This significant change to the city's tourist industry significantly influenced white civic leaders' decision to occasionally modify Jim Crow practices for Latin American vacationers. In effect, Miami's early Latinization had a profound impact on the established racial order as speaking Spanish became a form of currency that benefited Spanish-speaking tourists—even those of African descent. Paradoxically, this ostensibly peculiar racial climate aided the local struggle by highlighting the idiosyncrasies of Jim Crow while perpetuating the second-class status of native-born blacks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Rose","given":"Chanelle N."}],"citation-key":"rose2012","container-title":"Journal of Social History","ISSN":"0022-4529","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"735-756","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Tourism and the Hispanicization of race in Jim Crow Miami, 1945-1965","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41678907","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"rotondoetal2021","abstract":"The prospect of exploiting memory reconsolidation to treat mental health disorders has received great research interest, particularly following demonstrations that the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, which is safe for use in humans, can disrupt the reconsolidation of pavlovian conditioned fear memories. However, recent studies have failed to replicate the effects of propranolol on fear memory reconsolidation, and have questioned whether treatments based upon reconsolidation blockade would be robust enough for clinical translation. It remains possible, though, that studies reporting no effect of propranolol on memory reconsolidation could be due to a failure to engage the memory destabilisation process, which is necessary for the memory to become susceptible to disruption with amnestic agents. Demonstrating that memory destabilisation has not been engaged is challenging when only using behavioural measures, but there are molecular correlates of memory destabilisation that can be used to determine whether memory lability has been induced. Here, we attempted to replicate the classic finding that systemic administration of propranolol disrupts the reconsolidation of a pavlovian auditory fear memory. Following a failure to replicate, we manipulated the parameters of the memory reactivation session to enhance prediction error in an attempt to overcome the boundary conditions of reconsolidation. On finding no disruption of memory despite these manipulations, we examined the expression of the post-synaptic density protein Shank in the basolateral amygdala. Degradation of Shank has been shown to correlate with the induction of memory lability, but we found no effect on Shank expression, consistent with the lack of observed behavioural effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rotondo","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Biddle","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Chen","given":"John"},{"family":"Ferencik","given":"Josh"},{"family":"Esneval","given":"Mathilde","non-dropping-particle":"d'"},{"family":"Milton","given":"Amy L."}],"citation-key":"rotondoetal2021","container-title":"Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroscience.2021.11.008","ISSN":"0306-4522","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,10]]},"language":"en","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Lack of effect of propranolol on the reconsolidation of conditioned fear memory due to a failure to engage memory destabilisation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452221005571"},

  {"id":"roysircar1996","abstract":"Counseling professionals in the United States (U.S.) realize that they live in a multicultural, multietlmic, and diverse socioeconomic society. The complexity of this society challenges the cOlU1selor (\"counselor\" is used to include all psychological service providers) to revise and relearn the help-giving process. This challenge has been taken up by multicultural training (MCT). MCT's challenge is professional, philosophical, and political in nature.\nProfessional mandates of the American Association for Counseling and Development (AACD, 1988) (now called American Counseling Association [ACA]) and the American Psychological Association (APA) (APA, 1992; APA Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs, 1993) that influence lU1iversity accreditation and provide professional ethics are one reason for including MCT in master's and doctoral training.\nThere is another motivation for MCT that is less pragmatic and more implicit than professional guidelines. It is the philosophical ideology of wanting respect for differences of cultural groups and of envisioning multiculturalism as a peaceful process to co-existence in the 21st century. The third motivation has led to a political or advocacy mission that redresses the conditions of under-representation, racism, and inequity in U.S. institutions.\nMCT is being increasingly provided via either university course work or topic-focused continuing education workshops. Consequently, there is a need to evaluate MCT (D'Andrea, Daniels, & Heck, 1991; Ponterotto et al., Chapter 7 this volume; Pope-Davis, Chapter 9 this volume; Ridley, Mendoza, & Kanitz, 1994; Sodowsky & Taffe, 1991). The Multicultural Counseling Inventory (MCI) (Sodowsky, Taffe, Gutkin, & Wise, 1994a), a self-report measure, was developed for two purposes: to offer philosophical support to MCT and to present a robust instrument to measure multicultural counseling competencies, an expected outcome of MCT.","author":[{"family":"Roysircar","given":"Gargi"}],"citation-key":"roysircar1996","container-title":"Multicultural Assessment in Counseling and Clinical Psychology","container-title-short":"Multicultural Assessment in Counseling and Clinical Psychology","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996,4,1]]},"page":"283-324","source":"ResearchGate","title":"The Multicultural Counseling Inventory: Validity And Applications In Multicultural Training","title-short":"The Multicultural Counseling Inventory","type":"chapter","volume":"8"},

Beyond the descriptors of transgender and lesbian, the counselors were least comfortable with the mere discussion of sexual intimacy and its place in the presenting problem for this couple. The arenas of clinical supervision, self of the therapist, and counselor preparation as it may promote active exploration of sexual intimacy discussion in the arena of couples counseling are explored along with implications for counselor educators’ and supervisors’ own ability to promote this candid and needed discussion with supervisees.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Rutter","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Leech","given":"Nancy N."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Maggie"},{"family":"Saunders","given":"Diana"}],"citation-key":"rutteretal2010","container-title":"Journal of GLBT Family Studies","container-title-short":"Journal of GLBT Family Studies","DOI":"10.1080/15504280903472816","ISSN":"1550-428X, 1550-4298","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,2,3]]},"language":"en","page":"68-79","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Couples counseling for a transgender-lesbian couple: Student counselors’ comfort and discomfort with sexuality counseling topics","title-short":"Couples counseling for a transgender-lesbian couple","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15504280903472816","volume":"6"},

Nevertheless, although CAT of different domains mostly co-occurs, and co-morbidity is common, the associations between CAT and mental disorders, when taking these interrelations into account, are not well known. Aims: We aimed to study differential associations between the five core domains of CAT and current axis-I disorders, taking into consideration their interrelations.\nMethods: Four hundred and fifteen outpatients attending adult primary (n ¼ 255) and psychiatric care (n ¼ 160) were assessed with the Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Associations between CAT core domains and diagnostic categories were examined by path analyses.\nResults: At least some infrequent experience of CAT (83.6%), mostly of neglect, and current mental disorders (49.4%), mostly depression, was frequent, as were co-morbidities and co-occurrence of CAT domains. Considering these interrelations in a path model of excellent fit, physical abuse predicted depressive, manic, psychotic and anxiety disorders, whereas emotional neglect predicted depressive, anxiety and substance misuse disorders.\nConclusions: Of all five CAT core domains, physical abuse and emotional neglect had the strongest association with adult psychiatric disorders and might have transmitted earlier reported main effects of other CAT domains onto mental disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Salokangas","given":"Raimo K.

The current study characterized progression from alcohol use initiation - defined alternatively as first drink, first intoxication, and regular drinking onset - to AUD in young African American and European American youth.\n\nMethods\nPsychiatric interviews were administered via telephone to 1,461 participants (56% African American, 44% European American) in a high-risk family study (50.3% female, mean age=17.6, SD=3.8). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted separately for the African American and European American subsamples to predict DSM-5 AUD as a function of age at alcohol use initiation, with age at first drink, age at first intoxication, and age at regular drinking onset as the point of origin in separate models.\n\nResults\nAcross race/ethnicity, regardless of how it was measured, early alcohol use initiation predicted AUD, but hazard ratios (HRs) were lowest for first drink. Regular smoking and social anxiety disorder were significant predictors in both racial/ethnic groups but associations with conduct disorder (all 3 models: HR range=2.07–4.15) and major depressive disorder (regular drinking: HR=4.51, CI:1.60–12.69 for AUD onset age ≥20) were specific to African Americans.

Childhood trauma was defined alternately as child maltreatment and more broadly to include other events (e.g., witnessing violence). Phenotypic associations between childhood trauma and alcohol outcomes were estimated using logistic regression analyses. Twin modeling was conducted to test for moderating effects of childhood trauma on the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to timing of initiation and alcohol use disorder.\n\nResults\nUnder both definitions, childhood trauma was associated with early initiation (relative risk ratios: 1.90, 1.72) and alcohol use disorder (odds ratios: 1.92, 1.76).

  {"id":"schenbergetal2017","abstract":"Background Substance use disorders are important contributors to the global burden of disease, but current treatments are not associated with high rates of recovery. The lack of approved and effective treatments is acutely problematic for psychostimulants like cocaine and crack cocaine. One promising alternative in the treatment of drug dependence in general and psychostimulants in particular is the use of the psychedelic alkaloid ibogaine combined with psychotherapy. This was recently shown to induce prolonged periods of abstinence in polydrug users, including psychostimulants. However, drug dependence treatments cannot be comprehensively evaluated with reductions in consumption alone, with current recommendations including secondary outcome measures like craving, family and social relationship, quality of life, and self-efficacy. Methods We therefore employed a directed approach to qualitative content analysis to evaluate the outcomes of a treatment combining ibogaine with cognitive-behavioral therapy based on data gathered from patient’s reports obtained in semi-structured interviews. Main findings The results revealed that patients benefited from the treatment in all the secondary outcomes, reporting decreases in craving and improvements in personal relationships, quality of life, and self-efficacy, thus supporting existing notions that treatments combining ibogaine and psychotherapy do have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of substance use disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Schenberg","given":"Eduardo Ekman"},{"family":"Comis","given":"Maria Angélica de Castro"},{"family":"Alexandre","given":"João Felipe Morel"},{"family":"Chaves","given":"Bruno Daniel Rasmussen"},{"family":"Tófoli","given":"Luís Fernando"},{"family":"Silveira","given":"Dartiu Xavier","dropping-particle":"da"}],"citation-key":"schenbergetal2017","container-title":"Journal of Psychedelic Studies","DOI":"10.1556/2054.01.2016.002","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"10-19","publisher":"Akadémiai Kiadó","section":"Journal of Psychedelic Studies","source":"akjournals.com","title":"Treating drug dependence with the aid of ibogaine: A qualitative study","title-short":"Treating drug dependence with the aid of ibogaine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2054/1/1/article-p10.xml","volume":"1"},

Pharmacological manipulations at this stage result in an inability to retrieve the memories at later times, suggesting they are erased or persistently inhibited. Unfortunately, the use of these pharmacological manipulations in humans can be problematic. Here we introduce a non-invasive technique to target the reconsolidation of fear memories in humans. We provide evidence that old fear memories can be updated with non-fearful information provided during the reconsolidation window. As a consequence, fear responses were no longer expressed, an effect that lasted at least a year and was selective only to reactivated memories without affecting others. These findings demonstrate the adaptive role of reconsolidation as a window of opportunity to rewrite emotional memories, and suggest a non-invasive technique that can be used safely in humans to prevent the return of fear.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Schiller","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Monfils","given":"Marie-H."},{"family":"Raio","given":"Candace M."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"David C."},{"family":"LeDoux","given":"Joseph E."},{"family":"Phelps","given":"Elizabeth A."}],"citation-key":"schilleretal2010a","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature08637","ISSN":"0028-0836","issue":"7277","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,1,7]]},"page":"49-53","PMCID":"PMC3640262","PMID":"20010606","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Preventing the return of fear in humans using reconsolidation update mechanisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3640262/","volume":"463"},

A mediation analysis showed that scores on negative affectivity fully mediated the relationship between emotional neglect scores and psychiatric symptom scores.

We explore the evidence base for these adverse effects to elucidate which of these harms are based largely on anecdotes versus those that stand up to current scientific scrutiny.\nResults: Our review shows that medical risks are often minimal, and that many – albeit not all – of the persistent negative perceptions of psychological risks are unsupported by the currently available scientific evidence, with the majority of reported adverse effects not being observed in a regulated and/or medical context.\nConclusions: This highlights the importance for clinicians and therapists to keep to the highest safety and ethical standards.

This study aimed to evaluate whether contextual novelty can prevent cue-induced destabilization and disruption of a fear memory acquired by non-asymptotic learning. To this end, fear memory was reactivated in a novel context or in the original context of learning, and fear memory reactivation was followed by the administration of propranolol, an amnestic drug. Remarkably, fear memory was not impaired by post-reactivation propranolol administration or extinction training under the usual conditions used in our lab, irrespective of the reactivation context.

  {"id":"schuyleretal2020","abstract":"Sexual victimization, including sexual harassment and assault, remains a persistent problem in the U.S. military. Service members identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) may face enhanced risk, but existing research is limited. We examined experiences of sexual harassment, stalking, and sexual assault victimization during service in a sample of LGBT and non-LGBT active duty service members. Service members who identified as LGBT (n = 227 LGB, n = 56 transgender) or non-LGBT (n = 276) were recruited using respondent-driven sampling for an online survey. Logistic regression models examined the correlates of sexual and stalking victimization. Victimization was common among LGBT service members, including sexual harassment (80.7% LGB, 83.9% transgender), stalking (38.6% LGB, 30.4% transgender), and sexual assault (25.7% LGB, 30.4% transgender). In multivariable models, LGB identity remained a significant predictor of sexual harassment, OR = 4.14, 95% CI [2.21, 7.78]; stalking, OR = 1.98, 95% CI [1.27, 3.11]; and assault, OR = 2.07, 95% CI [1.25, 3.41]. A significant interaction between LGB identity and sex at birth, OR = 0.34, 95% CI [0.13, 0.88], suggests an elevated sexual harassment risk among male, but not female, LGB service members. Transgender identity predicted sexual harassment and assault at the bivariate level only. These findings suggest that LGBT service members remain at an elevated risk of sexual and/or stalking victimization. As the military works toward more integration and acceptance of LGBT service members, insight into victimization experiences can inform tailored research and intervention approaches aimed at prevention and care for victims.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Schuyler","given":"Ashley C."},{"family":"Klemmer","given":"Cary"},{"family":"Mamey","given":"Mary Rose"},{"family":"Schrager","given":"Sheree M."},{"family":"Goldbach","given":"Jeremy T."},{"family":"Holloway","given":"Ian W."},{"family":"Castro","given":"Carl Andrew"}],"citation-key":"schuyleretal2020","container-title":"Journal of Traumatic Stress","DOI":"10.1002/jts.22506","ISSN":"1573-6598","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"257-266","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Experiences of sexual harassment, stalking, and sexual assault during military service among LGBT and non-LGBT service members","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jts.22506","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"serieretal2019","abstract":"Objective:\nDespite high rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-induced deaths among Native Americans, there has been limited study of the construct validity of the AUD diagnostic criteria. The purpose of the current study was to examine the validity of the DSM-5 AUD criteria in a treatment-seeking group of Native Americans.\n\nMethods:\nAs part of a larger study, 79 Native Americans concerned about their alcohol or drug use were recruited from a substance use disorder treatment agency located on a reservation in the southwestern United States. Participants were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR; SCID-IV-TR) reworded to assess eleven DSM-5 criteria for AUD. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the validity of the AUD diagnostic criteria, and item response theory (IRT) was used to examine the item characteristics of the AUD diagnosis in this Native American sample.\n\nResults:\nCFA indicated that a one-factor model of the eleven items provided a good fit of the data. IRT parameter estimates suggested that “withdrawal,” “social/interpersonal problems,” and “activities given up to use” had the highest discrimination parameters. “Much time spent using” and “activities given up to use” had the highest severity parameters.\n\nConclusions:\nThe current study provided support for the validity of AUD DSM-5 criteria and a unidimensional latent construct of AUD in this sample of treatment-seeking Native Americans. IRT analyses replicate findings from previous studies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the validity of the DSM-5 AUD criteria in a treatment-seeking sample of Native Americans. Continued research in other Native American samples is needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Serier","given":"Kelsey N."},{"family":"Venner","given":"Kamilla L."},{"family":"Sarafin","given":"Ruth E."}],"citation-key":"serieretal2019","container-title":"Journal of addiction medicine","container-title-short":"J Addict Med","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000000452","ISSN":"1932-0620","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"35-40","PMCID":"PMC6349507","PMID":"30303888","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Evaluating the validity of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder diagnostic criteria in a sample of treatment seeking Native Americans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6349507/","volume":"13"},

We propose that effective therapists need to be able to manage their emotions, especially their anxiety, in order to truly help their clients. The failure to do this can lead to break downs in the alliance and the ﬂow of therapy, and these deleterious effects can be prevented when therapists actively navigate their internal states through self-awareness and ongoing introspection.

  {"id":"shean2014","abstract":"Despite the growing influence of lists of empirically supported therapies (ESTs) there are concerns about the design and conduct of this body of research. These concerns include limitations inherent in the requirements of randomized control trials (RCTs) that favor those psychotherapies that define problems and outcome in terms of uncomplicated symptoms. Additional concerns have to do with criteria for patient selection, lack of integration with research on psychotherapy process and effectiveness studies, limited outcome criteria, and lack of controls for experimenter bias. RCT designs have an important place in outcome research; however it is important to recognize that these designs also place restrictions on what and how psychotherapy can be studied. There is a need for large scale psychotherapy outcome research based on designs that allow for inclusion of process variables and the study of the effects of those idiographic approaches to therapy that do not lend themselves to RCT designs. Interpretative phenomenological analysis may provide a useful method for the evaluation of the effectiveness of idiographic approaches to psychotherapy where outcome is not understood solely in terms of symptom reduction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Shean","given":"Glenn"}],"citation-key":"shean2014","container-title":"Advances in Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1155/2014/561452","ISSN":"2356-685X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,6]]},"language":"en","page":"e561452","publisher":"Hindawi","source":"www.hindawi.com","title":"Limitations of Randomized Control Designs in Psychotherapy Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/apsy/2014/561452/","volume":"2014"},

  {"id":"shoreetal2021","abstract":"This study examined the effects of resume writing quality and ethnicity cues on employment decisions. Prior research on resume quality is scant and no prior studies have examined the role of both resume quality and ethnicity on employment decisions. Participants reviewed a fictitious resume (error-laden or error-free) of a Black, Hispanic or White candidate for the job of Sales Manager. Applicants with error-laden resumes were less likely to be interviewed, hired, offered lower starting salaries and rated lower on job-related traits than applicants with error-free resumes. Although ethnicity did not affect the likelihood of getting interviewed or hired, White applicants were offered higher salaries and rated higher on several job-related traits than Black and Hispanic job applicants. Furthermore, Black applicants with error-free resumes received over 6% less in starting salary than White applicants with error-laden resumes. A practical implication of these findings is that applicants should ensure that their resume contains no spelling, grammatical or typographical errors. These results also suggest that non-White job applicants need job qualifications that exceed those of White applicants to achieve pay equity.

  {"id":"silvestrini2020","abstract":"Sexual racism, a form of prejudice enacted in sexual or romantic settings, is a complex phenomenon that can interact with racial stereotypes and media representations of beauty to affect interracial attraction. Research suggests that racialized beauty standards and racial stereotypes can perpetuate broader racist tendencies in social interactions. This study aims to develop a critical understanding of how undergraduate students conceptualize the intersection of race and sexuality, and how racial identity shapes their sexual and romantic experiences. Using a qualitative methodology of survey analysis and in-depth interviews, this study examines the attitudes and behaviors of students at a large public university in California, and focuses on the thematic analysis of qualitative data obtained during eighteen student interviews. This research identifies three significant themes: (1) the impact of racial stereotypes on interracial attraction, (2) the media’s tendency to perpetuate Whiteness as a standard of beauty, and (3) the harmful consequences of sexual racism on students’ self-esteem and self-worth. Findings suggest that racial stereotypes, beauty standards, and sexual racism are prevalent among this student community and have harmful consequences for students of color, including decreased self-esteem, sexual repercussions, and internalized racism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Silvestrini","given":"Molly"}],"citation-key":"silvestrini2020","container-title":"Sexuality & Culture","container-title-short":"Sexuality & Culture","DOI":"10.1007/s12119-019-09644-0","ISSN":"1936-4822","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"305-325","source":"Springer Link","title":"“It’s not something I can shake”: The Effect of Racial Stereotypes, Beauty Standards, and Sexual Racism on Interracial Attraction","title-short":"“It’s not something I can shake”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-019-09644-0","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"sinclairbarense2018","abstract":"Through the process of “reconsolidation,” reminders can temporarily destabilize memories and render them vulnerable to change. Recent rodent research has proposed that prediction error, or the element of surprise, is a key component of this process; yet, this hypothesis has never before been extended to complex episodic memories in humans. In our novel paradigm, we used naturalistic stimuli to demonstrate that prediction error enables adaptive updating of episodic memories. In Study 1, participants (N = 48) viewed 18 videos, each depicting an action–outcome event. The next day, we reactivated these memories by presenting the videos again. We found that incomplete reminders, which interrupted videos before the outcome, made memories vulnerable to subsequent interference from a new set of videos, producing false memories. In Study 2 (N = 408), an independent sample rated qualities of the stimuli. We found that videos that were more surprising when interrupted produced more false memories. Last, in Study 3 (N = 24), we tested competing predictions of reconsolidation theory and the Temporal Context Model, an alternative account of source confusion. Consistent with the mechanistic time-course of reconsolidation, our effects were crucially time-dependent. Overall, we synthesize prior animal and human research to present compelling evidence that prediction error destabilizes episodic memories and drives dynamic updating in the face of new information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinclair","given":"Alyssa H."},{"family":"Barense","given":"Morgan D."}],"citation-key":"sinclairbarense2018","container-title":"Learning & Memory","container-title-short":"Learn.

  {"id":"singer2007","abstract":"Who are you? When you start to explore this question, you find out how elusive it really is. Are you a physical body? A collection of experiences and memories? A partner to relationships? Each time you consider these aspects of yourself, you realize that there is much more to you than any of these can define. The Untethered Soul, spiritual teacher Michael Singer explores the question of who we are and arrives at the conclusion that our identity is to be found in our consciousness, the fact of our ability to observe ourselves, and the world around us. By tapping into traditions of meditation and mindfulness, Singer shows how the development of consciousness can enable us all to dwell in the present moment and let go of painful thoughts and memories that keep us from achieving happiness and self-realization. This book, copublished with the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS), offers a frank and friendly discussion of consciousness and how we can develop it. In part one, he examines the notion of self and the inner dialogue we all live with. Part two examines the experience of energy as it flows through us and works to show readers how to open their hearts to the energy of experience that permeates their lives. Ways to overcome tendencies to close down to the rest of the world are the subject of part three. Enlightenment, the embrace of universal consciousness, is the subject of part four. And finally, in part five, Singer returns to daily life and the pursuit of unconditional happiness. Throughout, the book maintains a light and engaging tone, free from heavy dogma and prescriptive religious references. The easy exercises that figure in each chapter help readers experience the ideas that Singer presents.","author":[{"family":"Singer","given":"Michael A."}],"citation-key":"singer2007","edition":"1st edition","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10,3]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"199","publisher":"New Harbinger Publications","source":"Amazon","title":"The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself","title-short":"The Untethered Soul","type":"book"},

  {"id":"siomek-goreckaetal2021","abstract":"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a very common and complex disease, as alcohol is the most widely used addictive drug in the world. This disorder has an enormous impact on public health and social and private life, and it generates a huge number of social costs. Alcohol use stimulates hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis responses and is the cause of many physical and social problems (especially liver disease and cancer), accidental injury, and risky sexual behavior. For years, researchers have been trying to identify the genetic basis of alcohol use disorder, the molecular mechanisms responsible for its development, and an effective form of therapy. Genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute to the development of AUD, and the expression of genes is a complicated process that depends on epigenetic modulations. Dietary nutrients, such as vitamins, may serve as one these modulators, as they have a direct impact on epigenomes. In this review, we connect gathered knowledge from three emerging ﬁelds—genetics, epigenetics, and nutrition—to form an amazing triangle relating to alcohol use disorder.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Siomek-Gorecka","given":"Agnieszka"},{"family":"Dlugosz","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Czarnecki","given":"Damian"}],"citation-key":"siomek-goreckaetal2021","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22084262","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,20]]},"language":"en","page":"4262","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The molecular basis of alcohol use disorder (AUD).

Some research shows that veterans who have experienced PTSD have a high likelihood of developing AUD, perhaps reflecting the self-medication hypothesis. Other research shows that people with substance use disorder are likely to be exposed to traumatic situations and develop PTSD.

  {"id":"soeterkindt2015","abstract":"Background\nAlthough disrupting the process of memory reconsolidation has a great potential for clinical practice, the fear-amnesic effects are typically demonstrated through Pavlovian conditioning. Given that older and stronger memories are generally more resistant to change, we tested whether disrupting reconsolidation would also diminish fear in individuals who had developed a persistent spider fear outside the laboratory.\nMethods\nSpider-fearful participants received a single dose of 40 mg of the noradrenergic β-blocker propranolol (n = 15), double-blind and placebo-controlled (n = 15), after a short 2-min exposure to a tarantula. To test whether memory reactivation was necessary to observe a fear-reducing effect, one additional group of spider-fearful participants (n = 15) received a single dose of 40 mg propranolol without memory reactivation.\nResults\nDisrupting reconsolidation of fear memory transformed avoidance behavior into approach behavior in a virtual binary fashion—an effect that persisted at least 1 year after treatment. Interestingly the β-adrenergic drug did initially not affect the self-declared fear of spiders but instead these reports followed the instant behavioral transformation several months later.\nConclusions\nOur findings are in sharp contrast with the currently pharmacological and cognitive behavioral treatments for anxiety and related disorders. The β-adrenergic blocker was only effective when the drug was administered upon memory reactivation, and a modification in cognitive representations was not necessary to observe a change in fear behavior. A new wave of treatments that pharmacologically target the synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory seems to be within reach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Soeter","given":"Marieke"},{"family":"Kindt","given":"Merel"}],"citation-key":"soeterkindt2015","collection-title":"Mechanisms of Stress, Memory, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder","container-title":"Biological Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Biological Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.04.006","ISSN":"0006-3223","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,15]]},"language":"en","page":"880-886","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An Abrupt Transformation of Phobic Behavior After a Post-Retrieval Amnesic Agent","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322315003133","volume":"78"},
  {"id":"solbes-canalesetal2020","abstract":"Modern societies increasingly show more egalitarian attitudes related to sexism and gender equality. However, there is still an important gender gap in wages and professions as well as in expectations surrounding male and female characteristics. Developmental studies carried out from an ecological perspective confirm that these influences come from the closest environments (mainly family and school) but also from more distant systems such as media or cultural values. As children are socialized in these norms and values, they increasingly internalize those schemes and use them to judge others, to choose friends and playmates, and to construct expectations of them. On this basis, the aim of this study was to examine the degree of gender bias internalization in a group of Spanish children. Two tasks were applied to a group of 149 public school boys and girls (aged 4–9 years). Results showed that, already from an early age, the participants had internalized traditional gender roles, especially when asked to assign masculine attributes. Moreover, group differences were found given that boys seemed to be more aware of expectations surrounding masculinity and girls assigned the attributes associated with femininity to women more often than boys. Furthermore, a developmental pattern similar to one obtained in previous studies was observed. Younger children already apply gender roles as part of their increasing acquisition of knowledge in the social field, but there is a big increase in the strength of this bias as they grow older. Psychological and educational implications of these findings are discussed, especially considering that the male gender role seems to be more rigid and less malleable. In this regard, developmental and environmental studies should be considered when designing early intervention programs to reduce sexism and to promote equity in schools and families. As research has already shown what type of environments affect children’s acquisition of traditional gender roles, society must make an effort to promote more egalitarian environments that will serve as protective factors in their future psychological, social and professional development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Solbes-Canales","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Valverde-Montesino","given":"Susana"},{"family":"Herranz-Hernández","given":"Pablo"}],"citation-key":"solbes-canalesetal2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00609","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"609","source":"Frontiers","title":"Socialization of Gender Stereotypes Related to Attributes and Professions Among Young Spanish School-Aged Children","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00609","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"soon2020","abstract":"To what extent should we focus on implicit bias in order to eradicate persistent social injustice? Structural prioritizers argue that we should focus less on individual minds than on unjust social structures, while equal prioritizers think that both are equally important. This article introduces the framework of transactive memory into the debate to defend the equal priority view.

The chapter addresses assessment and treatment considerations (including the role of medical transition, masturbation, safe sex, and dating) with trans clients before providing a clinical illustration of these issues through two composite case studies. Considerations specifically for providers including discussion of the provider role, the impact of gender roles and stereotypes, and generational differences between younger and older clients, are discussed.

  {"id":"spira2017","abstract":"Everybody is aware, all seven billion of us. We are aware of thoughts, feelings, sensations, and perceptions. All people share the experience of being aware, but relatively few people are aware that they are aware. Most people’s lives consist of a flow of thoughts, images, ideas, feelings, sensations, sights, sounds, and so on. Very few people ask, 'What is it that knows this flow of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions? With what am I aware of my experience?'The knowing of our being—or rather, awareness’s knowing of its own being in us—is our primary, fundamental and most intimate experience. It is in this experience that the peace, happiness and love for which all people long reside. The happiness we have sought so long outside of ourselves, in situations, objects and relationships, turns out to be always present and available in the simple knowing of our own being as it truly is.The knowing of our own being shines in each of us as the experience ‘I am’ or ‘I am aware’, or simply the knowledge ‘I’. This obvious, familiar and intimate experience has no objective qualities and is, therefore, overlooked or ignored by the majority of people. This overlooking of our own being is the ultimate cause of unhappiness. What is the nature of the experience of being aware or awareness itself? The exploration of this question is the subject matter of this book and the essence of the Direct Path to peace and happiness.*   *   *The Essence of Meditation Series presents meditations on the essential, non-dual understanding that lies at the heart of all the great religious and spiritual traditions, compiled from contemplations led by Rupert Spira at his meetings and retreats. This simple, contemplative approach, which encourages a clear seeing of one’s experience rather than any kind of effort or discipline, leads the reader to an experiential understanding of their own essential being and the peace and fulfillment that are inherent within it. Being Aware of Being Aware is the first and introductory volume in The Essence of Meditation Series.","author":[{"family":"Spira","given":"Rupert"}],"citation-key":"spira2017","edition":"1st edition","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,1]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"126","publisher":"Sahaja","source":"Amazon","title":"Being Aware of Being Aware","type":"book"},

  {"id":"stemerdingetal2022","abstract":"Disrupting memory reconsolidation provides an opportunity to abruptly reduce the behavioural expression of fear memories with long-lasting effects. The success of a reconsolidation intervention is, however, not guaranteed as it strongly depends on the destabilization of the memory. Identifying the necessary conditions to trigger destabilization remains one of the critical challenges in the field. We aimed to replicate a study from our lab, showing that the occurrence of a prediction error (PE) during reactivation is necessary but not sufficient for destabilization. We tested the effectiveness of a reactivation procedure consisting of a single PE, compared to two control groups receiving no or multiple PEs. All participants received propranolol immediately after reactivation and were tested for fear retention 24 h later. In contrast to the original results, we found no evidence for a reconsolidation effect in the single PE group, but a straightforward interpretation of these results is complicated by the lack of differential fear retention in the control groups. Our results corroborate other failed reconsolidation studies and exemplify the complexity of experimentally investigating this process in humans. Thorough investigation of the interaction between learning and memory reactivation is essential to understand the inconsistencies in the literature and to improve reconsolidation interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Stemerding","given":"Lotte E."},{"family":"Stibbe","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Ast","given":"Vanessa A.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Kindt","given":"Merel"}],"citation-key":"stemerdingetal2022","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-06119-5","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,10]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"2285","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Demarcating the boundary conditions of memory reconsolidation: An unsuccessful replication","title-short":"Demarcating the boundary conditions of memory reconsolidation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06119-5","volume":"12"},

Of the numerous pharmacological actions of ibogaine and its derivatives, the inhibition of α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), represents a probable mechanism of action for their apparent anti-addictive activity. In this Perspective, we examine several classes of compounds that have been discovered and developed to target α3β4 nAChRs. Specifically, by focusing on compounds that have proven efficacious in pre-clinical models of drug abuse and have been evaluated clinically, we highlight the promising potential of the α3β4 nAChRs as viable targets to treat a wide array of SUDs.

  {"id":"straudetal2019","abstract":"There is conflicting evidence as to whether military populations (i.e., veteran and active-duty military service members) demonstrate a poorer response to psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to civilians. Existing research may be complicated by the fact that treatment outcomes differences could be due to the type of trauma exposure (e.g., combat) or population differences (e.g., military culture). This meta-analysis evaluated PTSD treatment outcomes as a function of trauma type (combat v. assault v. mixed) and population (military v. civilian). Unlike previous meta-analyses, we focused exclusively on manualized, first-line psychotherapies for PTSD as defined by expert treatment guidelines. Treatment outcomes were large across trauma types and population; yet differences were observed between trauma and population subgroups. Military populations demonstrated poorer treatment outcomes compared to civilians. The combat and assault trauma subgroups had worse treatment outcomes compared to the mixed trauma subgroup, but differences were not observed between assault and combat subgroups. Higher attrition rates predicted poorer treatment outcomes, but did not vary between military populations and civilians. Overall, manualized, first-line psychotherapies for PTSD should continue to be used for civilians and military populations with various trauma types. However, greater emphasis should be placed on enhancing PTSD psychotherapies for military populations and on treatment retention across populations based on findings from this meta-analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Straud","given":"Casey L."},{"family":"Siev","given":"Jedidiah"},{"family":"Messer","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Zalta","given":"Alyson K."}],"citation-key":"straudetal2019","container-title":"Journal of Anxiety Disorders","container-title-short":"Journal of Anxiety Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.janxdis.2019.102133","ISSN":"0887-6185","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102133","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Examining military population and trauma type as moderators of treatment outcome for first-line psychotherapies for PTSD: A meta-analysis","title-short":"Examining military population and trauma type as moderators of treatment outcome for first-line psychotherapies for PTSD","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618518303347","volume":"67"},

This paper illuminates the need to address the mental and emotional aspects. Specific attention is given to what is missing in the literature including, but not limited to: ableism/disability, visibility/invisibility, eroticsm/ otherism, and sexualization/asexualization. The preliminary research in medical/ psychological journals, books, and sexual health information sources indicates that the war on Black bodies is historic, current, social, and medical.

  {"id":"talmonetal2019","abstract":"Background\nThe transition to motherhood involves many challenges that require adjustment; included among them are adapting to body changes, forging a maternal identity, and attaching to the baby. Although these tasks may not be easy for any women, those who experienced emotional neglect during childhood may find them especially difficult.\nObjective\nThe aim of the current study was to examine a model illuminating the mechanism underlying the association between childhood emotional neglect and women’s adjustment during pregnancy and the postpartum period.\nParticipants and setting\nThree hundred and ninety four Israeli women participated in the study, during their pregnancy (Time 1) and two months postpartum (Time 2).\nMethods\nParticipants filled out a battery of questionnaires assessing their history of childhood emotional neglect, body experience, maternal self-efficacy, attachment to the fetus/baby, and depression.\nResults\nResults from structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that childhood emotional neglect was associated with depression at both Time 1 and Time 2. These associations were mediated by the body experience during pregnancy (Time 1) and motherhood (Time 2) as well as by anticipated maternal self-efficacy (Time 1) and maternal self-efficacy (Time 2). The model explained 56% of the variance of postpartum depression (Time 2).\nConclusions\nThese findings point to the long-term implications of childhood emotional neglect for women’s adjustment to the transition to motherhood.

  {"id":"taoetal2011","abstract":"Background:\nMost studies address medical treatment of infertility and psychosocial outcomes caused by infertility-related stress, but few studies examine the infertility's impact on sexuality.\n\nAim:\nA literature review was conducted to answer the questions: 1) How is sexual self concept impacted in infertile individuals and their partners? 2) Does infertility have a negative impact on sexual relationships? 3) Is sexual function affected by infertility? In answering these questions, we may develop a better understanding of sexuality in the context of infertility, and thus better inform infertility management. Ultimately the aim is to improve the quality of life for infertile couples.\n\nMethod:\nA literature search was conducted for publications from 1990 to 2011 via the electronic databases PubMed, PsycInfo and Scopus, which focused on sexuality in infertile subjects or couples.\n\nResults:\nIn this review, all studies were descriptive quantitative studies which mapped the different aspects of sexuality in the context of infertility. The results suggested that infertility and its treatment approaches for fertilisation could lead to changes in sexual self-esteem, sexual relationship and sexual function.\n\nConclusion:\nThe literature substantiated that many infertile subjects experienced trouble in various aspects of sexuality. However, further research should examine the reciprocal relations between sexual self concept, sexual relationship and sexual function in the context of infertility. How these changes affect the partners of infertile subjects should also be addressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Tao","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Coates","given":"Rosemary"},{"family":"Maycock","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"taoetal2011","container-title":"The Australasian Medical Journal","container-title-short":"Australas Med J","DOI":"10.4066/AMJ.20111055","ISSN":"1836-1935","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,11,30]]},"page":"620-627","PMCID":"PMC3562919","PMID":"23386877","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The impact of infertility on sexuality: A literature review","title-short":"The impact of infertility on sexuality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3562919/","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"tascaetal2017","abstract":"Is group therapy effective if it results in members revealing greater unresolved/disorganized mental states related to childhood trauma? That is, do patients have to more fully experience partially disavowed trauma before they get better? We found a small proportion of patients whose pre-treatment Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) transcripts were not coded as Unresolved/Disorganized at the start of group treatment, but were coded as such at the end. In one case report, we examined pre- and six months post–AAI transcripts and group therapy interactions to document the emergence of an unresolved/disorganized mental state. Despite the increase in disorganization, the patient showed some symptom improvement and improved reflective functioning. The 16-week psychodynamic group therapy allowed the patient to reflect on her traumatic experiences and their impact on her life. However, this also resulted in a disorganizing effect on her mental state. Longerterm therapy may be necessary to improve interpersonal functioning and affect regulation in patients who experienced early trauma.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Tasca","given":"Giorgio A."},{"family":"Maxwell","given":"Hilary"},{"family":"Faye","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Balfour","given":"Louise"}],"citation-key":"tascaetal2017","container-title":"International Journal of Group Psychotherapy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Group Psychotherapy","DOI":"10.1080/00207284.2016.1260461","ISSN":"0020-7284, 1943-2836","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"240-258","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Feeling worse before feeling better: a case of increased disorganized mental states following group psychotherapy","title-short":"Feeling worse before feeling better","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207284.2016.1260461","volume":"67"},

  {"id":"thau2020","abstract":"Our romantic lives are influenced, to a large extent, by our perceptions of physical attractiveness – and the societal beauty standards that shape them. But what if we could free our desires from this fixation on looks? Science fiction writer Ted Chiang has explored this possibility in a fascinating short story – and scientific developments might, in the future, move it beyond the realm of fiction. In this paper, I lay out the prudential case for using “attraction-expanding technology,” and then consider it from a moral point of view. Using the technology would, in one respect, be morally good: it would benefit those whom prevailing beauty standards marginalize. But attraction-expanding technology also raises a moral concern – one that can be cast in non-harm-based and harm-based terms. I argue that the non-harm-based objection should be rejected, because it is incompatible with a moral principle central to queer rights. And the harm-based objection, I argue, is outweighed by the benefits of attraction-expanding technology, and undermined by the prerogative you have over your personal romantic choices. I conclude by considering whether, from the perspective of society, the development of attraction-expanding technology would be desirable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Thau","given":"Tena"}],"citation-key":"thau2020","container-title":"Ethical Theory and Moral Practice","container-title-short":"Ethic Theory Moral Prac","DOI":"10.1007/s10677-020-10114-y","ISSN":"1572-8447","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"915-929","source":"Springer Link","title":"Expanding the Romantic Circle","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10677-020-10114-y","volume":"23"},

Experiment 3 compared task performance across non-Black and Black participants.

  {"id":"thierreeetal2020","abstract":"Background: There is a dearth of therapeutic solutions for traumatized young patients. Trauma reactivation conducted under the influence of the reconsolidation blocker propranolol (Reconsolidation Therapy) is a simple, cost-effective treatment option that has some promising initial results in adults suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Objective: To explore the usefulness of this novel treatment in children. The primary outcome was the reduction of PTSD symptoms at the end of treatment, while secondary outcomes included reduction in anxiety and in depressive symptoms.Method: An open-label clinical trial was conducted in a refugee camp in Syria, investigating the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic strategy in 117 children suffering from enduring PTSD symptoms. Participants received propranolol 90 minutes before briefly recalling (i.e. reactivating) a single personal traumatic memory, for 5 consecutive days. Self-reported anxiety, depressive, and PTSD symptoms were assessed at baseline, as well as 4 and 13 weeks after treatment.Results: A significant, clinically meaningful symptom reduction was observed at all post-treatment measurement times vs. baseline. More specifically, between baseline and the 13-week follow-up we observed a 64% PTSD symptoms reduction (d = 2.71). In a similar vein, we obtained a 39% symptoms reduction for depressive symptoms (d = 1.01). The general anxiety symptoms improved, but eventually returned to prior level, probably because of the deteriorating living conditions in the camp.Conclusions: This therapy appeared as a potentially safe and useful treatment strategy for children suffering from PTSD symptoms, warranting replication studies using stronger study designs. The social acceptability and ease of implementation of the treatment should also be noted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Thierrée","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Richa","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Brunet","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Egreteau","given":"Laurine"},{"family":"Roig","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Clarys","given":"David"},{"family":"El-Hage","given":"Wissam"}],"citation-key":"thierreeetal2020","container-title":"European Journal of Psychotraumatology","DOI":"10.1080/20008198.2020.1733248","ISSN":"2000-8198","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,31]]},"page":"1733248","PMID":"32194925","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Trauma reactivation under propranolol among traumatized Syrian refugee children: preliminary evidence regarding efficacy","title-short":"Trauma reactivation under propranolol among traumatized Syrian refugee children","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2020.1733248","volume":"11"},

This review provides an overview of recent research on the prevalence and patterns of alcohol-related improvement and selectively reviews nationally representative surveys and studies that followed risk groups longitudinally with a goal of informing patients with AUD and AUD researchers, clinicians, and policy-makers about patterns of improvement in the population. Based on the research, alcohol use increases during adolescence and early adulthood and then decreases beginning in the mid-20s across the adult life span. Approximately 70% of persons with AUD and alcohol problems improve without interventions (natural recovery), and fewer than 25% utilize alcohol-focused services. Low-risk drinking is a more common outcome in untreated samples, in part because seeking treatment is associated with higher problem severity. Sex differences are more apparent in help-seeking than recovery patterns, and women have lower help-seeking rates than men. Whites are proportionately more likely to utilize services than are Blacks and Hispanics. Improving recovery rates will likely require offering interventions outside of the health care sector to affected communities and utilizing social networks and public health tools to close the longstanding gap between need and utilization of AUD-focused services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Tucker","given":"Jalie A."},{"family":"Chandler","given":"Susan D."},{"family":"Witkiewitz","given":"Katie"}],"citation-key":"tuckeretal2020","container-title":"Alcohol Research : Current Reviews","container-title-short":"Alcohol Res","DOI":"10.35946/arcr.v40.3.02","ISSN":"2168-3492","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,12]]},"page":"02","PMCID":"PMC7643818","PMID":"33194507","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Epidemiology of recovery from alcohol use disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7643818/","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"vaethetal2017","abstract":"Data from approximately 140 articles and reports published since 2000 on drinking, alcohol use disorder (AUD), correlates of drinking and AUD, and treatment needs, access and utilization were critically examined and summarized. Epidemiological evidence demonstrates alcohol-related disparities across U.S. racial/ethnic groups. American Indians/Alaska Natives generally drink more and are disproportionately affected by alcohol problems, having some of the highest rates for AUD. In contrast, Asian Americans are less affected. Differences across Whites, Blacks and Hispanics are more nuanced. The diversity in drinking and problem rates that is observed across groups also exists within groups, particularly among Hispanics, Asian Americans, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. Research findings also suggests that acculturation to the U.S. and nativity affect drinking. Recent studies on ethnic drinking cultures uncover the possible influence that native countries’ cultural norms around consumption still have on immigrants’ alcohol use. The reasons for racial/ethnic disparities in drinking and AUD are complex and are associated with historically-rooted patterns of racial discrimination and persistent socioeconomic disadvantage. This disadvantage is present at both individual and environmental levels. Finally, these data indicate that admission to alcohol treatment is also complex and is dependent on the presence and severity of alcohol problems but also on a variety of other factors. These include individuals’ sociodemographic characteristics, the availability of appropriate services, factors that may trigger coercion into treatment by family, friends, employers and the legal system, and the overall organization of the treatment system. More research is needed to understand facilitators and barriers to treatment to improve access to services and support. Additional directions for future research are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaeth","given":"Patrice A.C."},{"family":"Wang-Schweig","given":"Meme"},{"family":"Caetano","given":"Raul"}],"citation-key":"vaethetal2017","container-title":"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research","container-title-short":"Alcohol Clin Exp Res","DOI":"10.1111/acer.13285","ISSN":"0145-6008","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1]]},"page":"6-19","PMCID":"PMC5205547","PMID":"28019654","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Drinking, alcohol use disorder, and treatment access and utilization among U.S. racial/ethnic groups","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5205547/","volume":"41"},

However, little is known of sexual activity and satisfaction of transmen after phalloplasty or metoidioplasty. A clinical follow-up study was conducted in transmen at least one year after genital GAS in order to evaluate measures of experienced sexuality. Participants (N ¼ 38) received a set of self-constructed questionnaires on sexual relationships and orientation, use of genitals during sexual contact, and the experienced influence of surgery on sexuality. Twenty-nine had received phalloplasty, nine metoidioplasty. The average follow-up time was 32 months. The majority reported to be sexually active. The use and enjoyment of both chest and genitals during sexual activity increased after surgery. Other areas of improvement included arousability, sexual interest, and pleasure. Free text comments provided an insight into the role of genital sensation and sexual self-esteem in postoperative sexuality. In conclusion, genital GAS positively impacts transmen’s sexuality, although possible issues with genital sensation or penetration may exist and should be communicated preoperatively. Therefore, we recommend interdisciplinary collaboration on this subject.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Grift","given":"Tim C.","non-dropping-particle":"van de"},{"family":"Pigot","given":"Garry L.

  {"id":"vandykedrinkwater2014","abstract":"Objective: To review the peer-reviewed literature on relationships between intuitive eating and health indicators and suggest areas of inquiry for future research. We deﬁne the fundamental principles of intuitive eating as: (i) eating when hungry; (ii) stopping eating when no longer hungry/full; and (iii) no restrictions on types of food eaten unless for medical reasons. Design: We include articles cited by PubMed, PsycInfo and Science Direct published in peer-reviewed journals or theses that include ‘intuitive eating’ or related concepts in the title or abstract and that test relationships between intuitive eating and physical or mental health indicators.\nResults: We found twenty-six articles that met our criteria: seventeen cross-sectional survey studies and nine clinical studies, eight of which were randomised controlled trials. The cross-sectional surveys indicate that intuitive eating is negatively associated with BMI, positively associated with various psychological health indicators, and possibly positively associated with improved dietary intake and/or eating behaviours, but not associated with higher levels of physical activity. From the clinical studies, we conclude that the implementation of intuitive eating results in weight maintenance but perhaps not weight loss, improved psychological health, possibly improved physical health indicators other than BMI (e.g. blood pressure; cholesterol levels) and dietary intake and/or eating behaviours, but probably not higher levels of physical activity.\nConclusions: Research on intuitive eating has increased in recent years. Extant research demonstrates substantial and consistent associations between intuitive eating and both lower BMI and better psychological health. Additional research can add to the breadth and depth of these ﬁndings. The article concludes with several suggestions for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Dyke","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Drinkwater","given":"Eric J"}],"citation-key":"vandykedrinkwater2014","container-title":"Public Health Nutrition","container-title-short":"Public Health Nutr.","DOI":"10.1017/S1368980013002139","ISSN":"1368-9800, 1475-2727","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,8]]},"language":"en","page":"1757-1766","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Relationships between intuitive eating and health indicators: Literature review","title-short":"Review article relationships between intuitive eating and health indicators","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1368980013002139/type/journal_article","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"vaverkovaetal2020","abstract":"Maladaptive emotional memories contribute to the persistence of many mental health disorders, and therefore the prospect of disrupting these memories to produce long-term reductions in relapse is of great clinical appeal. Reducing the impact of maladaptive emotional memories on behaviour could be achieved by two retrieval-dependent manipulations that engage separate mnemonic processes: “reconsolidation disruption” and “extinction enhancement.” Extinction occurs during a prolonged re-exposure session in the absence of the expected emotional outcome and is widely accepted as reflecting the formation of a new, inhibitory memory that prevents behavioural expression of the original trace. Reconsolidation, by contrast, involves the destabilisation of the original memory, allowing for subsequent updating and restabilisation in specific brain regions, unless the re-stabilization process is prevented through specific pharmacological or behavioural interventions. Both destabilisation of the original memory and memory extinction require that re-exposure induces prediction error—a mismatch between what is expected and what actually occurs—but the parameters that allow reconsolidation and extinction to occur, and control the transition between them, have not been well-characterised. Here, we review what is known about the induction of memory destabilisation and extinction, and the transition period that separates these mnemonic processes, drawing on preclinical and clinical examples. A deeper understanding of the processes that determine the alternative routes to memory persistence or inhibition is critical for designing new and more reliable clinical treatments targeting maladaptive emotional memories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaverková","given":"Zuzana"},{"family":"Milton","given":"Amy L."},{"family":"Merlo","given":"Emiliano"}],"citation-key":"vaverkovaetal2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front Behav Neurosci","DOI":"10.3389/fnbeh.2020.574358","ISSN":"1662-5153","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,29]]},"PMCID":"PMC7550798","PMID":"33132861","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Retrieval-Dependent Mechanisms Affecting Emotional Memory Persistence: Reconsolidation, Extinction, and the Space in Between","title-short":"Retrieval-Dependent Mechanisms Affecting Emotional Memory Persistence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7550798/","volume":"14"},

Beck Depression Inventory Primary Care (BDI-PC), General Health Survey (SF-36), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and operated Male to Female Sexual Function Index (oMtFSI) questionnaires were web-based administered. Data included: age, area of origin, educational level, sexual orientation, years since surgery and hormone therapy.\nOutcomes\nT-test was applied to inspect mean score differences between oTW and cisW, in mental, sexual and physical health; simple correlations and multiple regression analysis revealed how mental, sexual and physical health were concurrently associated in the two groups\nResults\nResponse rate 60% (52% oTW, 71% cisW). oTW mean age 38.5 years (SD = 9.3), cisW 37.7 years (SD = 11.5). Both cisW and oTW reported average values in the range of mental, physical and sexual health. Statistical comparisons revealed no significant group differences in mental and physical health. oTW who referred a worse sexual function also reported worse overall mental well-being and higher levels of depressive symptoms. FSFI scores were negatively associated with years since surgery, but not with age. Multiple regression analysis showed that FSFI Pain accounted for a significant unique variance proportion of risk of depression in oTW. FSFI Sexual Pain was the strongest estimator of inter-individual differences in BDI-PC among oTW (P < .01).\nClinical Implications\nNo significant differences in the levels of depressive symptoms, physical and mental well- being were found in oTW and cis-W. The relation between depressive symptoms and sexual function in oTW is stronger than in cisW, and sexual pain substantially predicts risk of depression in oTW.\nStrengths & Limitations\nThe evaluation of outcomes using validated questionnaires and the relatively large sample size.

Reactivation of this memory on the background of blockade of de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide led to a significant decrease in freezing time in the conditioned context in rats. Administration of the selective neuronal NO synthase blocker 3-bromo-7-indazole in conditions of memory reactivation on the background of protein synthesis blockade prevented weakening of conditioned reflex freezing reactions, as demonstrated by subsequent testing of animals in the conditioned context. In addition, administration of 3-bromo-7-indazole without reactivation did not elicit significant changes in measures of conditioned reflex freezing in rats.

  {"id":"visseretal2018","abstract":"Memories that have strong emotions associated with them are particularly resilient to forgetting. This is not necessarily problematic, however some aspects of memory can be. In particular, the involuntary expression of those memories, e.g. intrusive memories after trauma, are core to certain psychological disorders. Since the beginning of this century, research using animal models shows that it is possible to change the underlying memory, for example by interfering with its consolidation or reconsolidation. While the idea of targeting maladaptive memories is promising for the treatment of stress and anxiety disorders, a direct application of the procedures used in non-human animals to humans in clinical settings is not straightforward. In translational research, more attention needs to be paid to specifying what aspect of memory (i) can be modified and (ii) should be modified. This requires a clear conceptualization of what aspect of memory is being targeted, and how different memory expressions may map onto clinical symptoms. Furthermore, memory processes are dynamic, so procedural details concerning timing are crucial when implementing a treatment and when assessing its effectiveness. To target emotional memory in its full complexity, including its malleability, science cannot rely on a single method, species or paradigm. Rather, a constructive dialogue is needed between multiple levels of research, all the way ‘from mice to mental health’.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Of mice and mental health: facilitating dialogue between basic and clinical neuroscientists'.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Visser","given":"Renée M."},{"family":"Lau-Zhu","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Henson","given":"Richard N."},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Emily A."}],"citation-key":"visseretal2018","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2017.0209","issue":"1742","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,19]]},"page":"20170209","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Multiple memory systems, multiple time points: how science can inform treatment to control the expression of unwanted emotional memories","title-short":"Multiple memory systems, multiple time points","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2017.0209","volume":"373"},

Memory reconsolidation therapy (MRT) was developed as an evolution of classic prolonged exposure therapy. The aim of this study was an initial assessment of MRT for comorbid BN and psychological trauma in a case series study.Method MRT was used in this study to reduce trauma symptoms which may maintain disordered eating behaviour. Two women with BN and PTSD, and an additional participant with comorbid BN and BPD/cPTSD, were offered 16 weekly sessions of MRT following baseline measures.Results At 3-month follow-up, all participants experienced a decrease in trauma symptoms as measured by the Impact of Event Scale–Revised. All participants also experienced a decrease in the frequency of self-reported BN behaviour.Conclusions In this case series patients with BN and PTSD/cPTSD/BPD showed improvement of BN and trauma symptoms. These results offer preliminary support for the inclusion of MRT for the treatment of psychological trauma in adults with BN.KEY POINTSWhat is already known about this topic: There is a high prevalence rate of comorbid bulimia nervosa and posttraumatic stress disorder.Engagement in disordered eating behaviours can be a maladaptive coping strategy in response to traumatic experiences.Preliminary studies support the efficacy of memory reconsolidation therapy in treating traumatic memories.What this topic adds: (1) The results provide preliminary evidence that memory reconsolidation therapy is efficacious in reducing trauma symptoms in adults with bulimia nervosa and comorbid PTSD/cPTSD.(2) The reduction in bulimia nervosa symptoms appeared to coincide with the reduction in trauma symptoms.(3) Treating posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in patients with comorbid bulimia nervosa and posttraumatic stress disorder has the potential to reduce both trauma symptoms and the frequency of self-reported disordered eating behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Vivian","given":"Katie"},{"family":"Strodl","given":"Esben"},{"family":"Kitamura","given":"Haruka"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Luke"}],"citation-key":"vivianetal2022","container-title":"Clinical Psychologist","DOI":"10.1080/13284207.2022.2065913","ISSN":"1328-4207","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"page":"1-12","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Memory reconsolidation therapy for comorbid bulimia nervosa and traumatic memories: a case series study","title-short":"Memory reconsolidation therapy for comorbid bulimia nervosa and traumatic memories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13284207.2022.2065913","volume":"0"},

In particular, gay males and lesbians reported experiencing more heterosexism than bisexuals, and gay males and bisexuals reported experiencing more internalized homophobia than lesbians. Participants who were classified as having at least one alcohol or drug use disorder were significantly more likely to have experienced heterosexism and internalized homophobia than those who were not classified as having a substance use disorder.

  {"id":"whitneyetal2022","abstract":"Background\nAs the field of gender-affirming care continues its advancement, a clinical gap in the definition and evaluation of sexual function in transgender and non-binary (TGNB) individuals is becoming increasingly apparent. Recent speculations propose the modification of cis-gender heteronormative sexual function measurement tools as a useful way to close this knowledge gap.\nMethods\nAlthough the use of previously validated tools creates an easier platform for modification, the assumption of cis-gender sexual function as baseline will further disrupt patient-provider relationships, leading to inaccurate scientific conclusions, and increase the healthcare barriers faced by this community.\nResults\nAs the definition of health has grown to include sexual function, the responsibility of the physician has evolved to include the treatment of sexual dysfunction as well. Without the imminent establishment of a scientific definition of sexual function with an accompanying measurement tool, this lack of understanding continues a precedent that may further stigmatize and distance this population from healthcare. Although this challenge may seem daunting, it should be noted that this has been accomplished for both cis-gender heterosexual men and women. This failure to scrupulously address the needs of the TGNB community directly contradicts the medical profession's revered values of equity and compassion. This branch of sexual medicine and gender-affirming care is critical for maximizing the quality of life as well as equity of the TGNB community to their cis-gender, heteronormative counterparts.\nConclusion\nA careful, kinder, and more inclusive approach is necessary, and the TGNB community deserves optimized care which requires a uniquely developed definition of sexual function and the required measurement tools.

  {"id":"widdowsmaccallum2018","abstract":"This article introduces a Special Issue comprising four papers emerging from the Beauty Demands Network project, and maps key issues in the beauty debate. The introduction first discusses the purpose of the Network; to consider the changing demands of beauty across disciplines and beyond academia. It then summarises the findings of the Network workshops, emphasising the complex place of notions of normality, and the different meanings and functions attached to ‘normal’ in the beauty context. Concerns are raised here about the use of normal to justify and motivate engaging in beauty practices such as cosmetic surgery and ‘non-invasive’ procedures. Other workshop findings included the recognition of beauty as increasingly a global value rather than a culturally distinct ideal, and the understanding that there is no clear distinction between beauty practices that are considered standard and those that are considered extreme. These themes, especially the concerns around understanding of normal, are reflected in the recommendations made by the Network in its Briefing Paper, which are presented next in this introduction. A further theme picked up by these recommendations is the extent to which individuals who are not traditionally vulnerable may be so in the beauty context. Finally, the introduction highlights the key matters covered in the four papers of the Special Issue: regulatory concerns around cosmetic surgery tourism; the impact of digitally altered images from psychological and philosophical perspectives; the ethics of genetic selection for fair skin; and the attraction and beauty of the contemporary athletic body.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Widdows","given":"Heather"},{"family":"MacCallum","given":"Fiona"}],"citation-key":"widdowsmaccallum2018","container-title":"Health Care Analysis","container-title-short":"Health Care Anal","DOI":"10.1007/s10728-018-0360-3","ISSN":"1065-3058, 1573-3394","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"language":"en","page":"207-219","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Demands of Beauty: Editors’ Introduction","title-short":"The Demands of Beauty","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10728-018-0360-3","volume":"26"},

Ninety‐four percent of the participants had phalloplasty.\nMain Outcome Measures\nSelf‐reported physical and mental health using the Dutch version of the Short Form‐36 Health Survey; sexual functioning before and after SRS using a newly constructed specific questionnaire.\nResults\nCompared with a Dutch reference population of community‐dwelling men, transsexual men scored well on self‐perceived physical and mental health. The majority reported having been sexually active before hormone treatment, with more than a quarter having been vaginally penetrated frequently before starting hormone therapy. There was a tendency toward less vaginal involvement during hormone therapy and before SRS. Most participants reported an increase in frequency of masturbation, sexual arousal, and ability to achieve orgasm after testosterone treatment and SRS. Almost all participants were able to achieve orgasm during masturbation and sexual intercourse, and the majority reported a change in orgasmic feelings toward a more powerful and shorter orgasm. Surgical satisfaction was high, despite a relatively high complication rate.\nConclusion\nResults of the current study indicate transsexual men generally have a good quality of life and experience satisfactory sexual function after SRS.

  {"id":"wileyetal2019","abstract":"Medicare beneﬁciaries are unable to access mental health services provided by some licensed master’s-level clinicians, including licensed professional counselors (LPCs). Provider shortages in rural localities, combined with Medicare policy exclusion of these licensed mental health professionals, exacerbates rural mental health care access disparities. Very little is known about the impact of LPC exclusion from Medicare on rural beneﬁciaries. This study explored the lived experiences of mental health professionals who have turned away clients because of their Medicare-ineligible provider status. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was employed as a qualitative form of inquiry to guide the research design, participant recruitment, data collection, and analysis. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 9 Medicare-ineligible mental health professionals from a single, Mid-Atlantic state in the United States who have turned away clients because of their Medicare-ineligible provider status. Evidence from rural and nonrural practitioners highlighted the contextual implications of Medicare provider exclusion on rural beneﬁciaries. One superordinate theme, undue burden, is described through three emergent themes from the interview data: geographical disparities, intersectional hardships, and practice constraints. The results suggest that current Medicare provider regulations may create disparities of mental health care availability and accessibility for Medicare beneﬁciaries from rural communities. The qualitative evidence of this study describes systemic and proximal factors that result in unexpected termination, deterred help-seeking behavior, and untimely treatment for older adults and disabled clients within rural mental health care settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wiley","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Fullen","given":"Matthew C."},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Amy A."}],"citation-key":"wileyetal2019","container-title":"Journal of Rural Mental Health","container-title-short":"Journal of Rural Mental Health","DOI":"10.1037/rmh0000119","ISSN":"2163-8969, 1935-942X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"language":"en","page":"118-129","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"“Bearing the burden”: Rural implications of licensed professionals’ exclusion from Medicare","title-short":"“bearing the burden”","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/rmh0000119","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"wilsonetal2020","abstract":"Abstract Ibogaine is a naturally occurring psychedelic medicine with anti-addictive properties. While research on ibogaine is limited, several observational studies have shown ibogaine can mitigate opioid withdrawal, as seen with reductions in clinical and subjective opioid withdrawal scores and reduced drug use severity (Noller, Frampton, & Yazar-Klosinski, 2018; Brown & Alper 2018). Furthermore, the psychoactive experience may help individuals to realign their values, purpose and sense of connection, as seen with post treatment reductions in depression scores (Noller et al., 2018; Mash et al., 2000). Case series This case series describes two cases of individuals accessing ibogaine through private unregulated clinics in the Vancouver area to treat their opioid use disorder. Conclusions In case 1, the client achieved total abstinence from all opioids within 5–6 days of starting ibogaine treatment, did not experience any opioid withdrawal symptoms after ibogaine treatment and maintained abstinence from opioids for 3 years. In case 2, the patient took ibogaine/iboga in multiple treatments over a short period of time (<4 months). The patient stopped all non-medical opioids after the first iboga treatment and then used ibogaine to aid with further dose reductions of her opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and has maintained abstinence from opioids for 2 years. Ibogaine offers a unique and novel therapeutic approach to treating opioid use disorder. Further studies are needed to establish the safety, risks and potential role for ibogaine as a mainstream, evidence-based addiction treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Millar","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Matieschyn","given":"Zak"}],"citation-key":"wilsonetal2020","container-title":"Journal of Psychedelic Studies","DOI":"10.1556/2054.2020.00133","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,31]]},"language":"en","page":"149-155","publisher":"Akadémiai Kiadó","section":"Journal of Psychedelic Studies","source":"akjournals.com","title":"Novel treatment of opioid use disorder using ibogaine and iboga in two adults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2054/4/3/article-p149.xml","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"wrightetal2009","abstract":"Objective\nTheoretically, exposure to experiences of emotional abuse (EA) and emotional neglect (EN) in childhood may threaten the security of attachment relationships and result in maladaptive models of self and self-in-relation to others. The purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which EA and EN treatment by parents contributed uniquely to young adult maladaptive long-term outcome with respect to symptoms of anxiety, depression, and dissociation. The extent to which the relationships between EA and EN and later symptoms were mediated by specific internalized maladaptive interpersonal schemas was also explored.\nMethods\nQuestionnaires completed by 301 college men and women (52% female) assessed perceptions of experiences of childhood abuse and neglect, exposure to parental alcoholism, current symptoms of psychological distress, and endorsement of maladaptive interpersonal schemas.\nResults\nHierarchical regression analyses revealed that perceptions of childhood EA and EN each continued to exert an influence on later symptoms after controlling for gender, income, parental alcoholism, and other child abuse experiences. Both EA and EN were associated with later symptoms of anxiety and depression and were mediated by schemas of vulnerability to harm, shame, and self-sacrifice. Only EN was related to later symptoms of dissociation; this relationship was mediated by the schemas of shame and vulnerability to harm.\nConclusion\nThe findings are discussed from an attachment perspective, focusing on how early interactions with parents contribute to the development of internal working models of self and self-in-relation to others that influence later cognitive schemas and psychological adjustment.\nPractice implications\nAlthough emotional abuse and emotional neglect are the least studied of all forms of child maltreatment, they may be the most prevalent. The current findings suggest that how college students have evaluated and internalized these experiences may be even more important than the events themselves in determining the extent to which these experiences exert a long-term impact. For this reason, early intervention might be particularly important in helping to modify internal working models of the self as worthless, others as abusive, or the world as threatening and dangerous as a result of past abuse experiences. This study underscores the need for counselors to actively elicit and explore experiences of emotional abuse and neglect in clients, in addition to inquiring about other abuse experiences and types of family dysfunction. The results of this study also support existing data suggesting that internalized representational models of self and others are a key mechanism underlying the relationship between emotional maltreatment and later psychopathology. Young's schema questionnaire proved to be quite sensitive in detecting specific maladaptive schemas that mediated later difficulties with depression, anxiety, and dissociation. Targeting these negative schemas in therapy may help to ameliorate such symptoms. The therapeutic relationship provides a particularly effective context for developing more positive models of self and others, as well as providing a context to explore core relationship themes across different relationship contexts (e.g., intimate partner, parent, friend, and work relationships). In particular, if the assessment of the client reveals that dissociative symptoms are present, counselors can acknowledge the adaptive function that this strategy once served, while also addressing potential limitations to over-reliance on this coping strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Margaret O’Dougherty"},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Del Castillo","given":"Darren"}],"citation-key":"wrightetal2009","container-title":"Child Abuse & Neglect","container-title-short":"Child Abuse & Neglect","DOI":"10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.12.007","ISSN":"0145-2134","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"59-68","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Childhood emotional maltreatment and later psychological distress among college students: The mediating role of maladaptive schemas","title-short":"Childhood emotional maltreatment and later psychological distress among college students","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213408002470","volume":"33"},

Research in this field has primarily focused on two main indications: 1) propranolol given to individuals prior to trauma memory reactivation in patients diagnosed with PTSD, and 2) propranolol given following trauma as a preventative measure for subsequent PTSD or acute stress disorder.12 The purpose of this report is to summarize the clinical evidence regarding the effectiveness of propranolol for the treatment and prevention of PTSD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Young","given":"Calvin"},{"family":"Butcher","given":"Robyn"}],"call-number":"NBK562942","citation-key":"youngbutcher2020","collection-title":"CADTH Rapid Response Reports","event-place":"Ottawa (ON)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"eng","license":"Copyright © 2020 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.","PMID":"33074615","publisher":"Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health","publisher-place":"Ottawa (ON)","source":"PubMed","title":"Propranolol for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness","title-short":"Propranolol for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder","type":"book","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562942/"},

We argue that alliance and expectancy contain both a trait-like common factor component and a state-like specific effect, and that it is clinically, conceptually and methodologically critical to disentangle the two. In other words, both alliance and expectancy may also function as active ingredients of treatment, leading to better outcome.
